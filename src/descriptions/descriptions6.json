But Newtonian Physics has always been seen as incomplete or inadequate in that it was deterministic, and left no room for the human experience of free will, or for God&#39;s actions within the world, the universe, the multiverse.\nThis began to change at the beginning of the last century with the work of Thompson, Rutherford, and Bohr leading to the understanding of atomic structure, beginning with protons, neutrons, and especially electrons but continuing with seemingly endless demonstrations leading to &quot;zoo&quot; of subatomic particles. It is at the sub-atomic level that Newtonian Physics breaks down, leading to the rapidly growing field of Quantum mechanics to explain what can be known and understood about the interactions of these subatomic realities. At this level we now know that what we call &quot;matter&quot; exists simultaneously in two forms, particles and waves. It is at this level that the &quot;behaviors&#39; of the components of all that we think of as matter seem to exercise independence and freedom. At this level we can only speak of probabilities not certitude. This independence and freedom within all that is real accordingly re-opens within the sciences space for legitimate explorations into the nature of life, consciousness and free will, as well as God&#39;s activity within material existence.

Intriguingly, this realization quickly followed the emergence of a similar realization about the historical and cultural particularities of the supposedly &lsquo;natural&rsquo; five senses. This seminar explores scholarship from emotions studies and sensory studies from a range of world regions and time periods in order to explore the contingent nature of the range of experiences we associate with the English words &ldquo;sensing&rdquo; and &ldquo;feeling.&rdquo; How and why are new ways of feeling invented in particular contexts? What is the relationship between emotional norms, sensory experiences, and political power, gender, religious practice, or consumer habits? Are emotions really what make us human or do we share that capacity with other creatures? Can trees feel pain? How might knowledge of emotional and sensorial regimes contribute to the crafting of fiscal or immigration policies or the delivery of mental health care? Each of these questions requires us to confront deeper epistemological and philosophical questions about the relationship between the mind &amp; the body, the individual &amp; society, biology &amp; culture.

Are some people just better than others at second language learning?\n- Are there differences in how languages may best be learned across different contexts (e.g., naturalistic exposure vs. classroom instruction vs. study abroad)? What about through different teaching methods?\n- What is the role of technology in second language learning? Can we learn languages just as well online as we do face-to-face?\n- What are the cognitive benefits of knowing more than one language? Can knowing another language affect the way you think?\n\nWe will accomplish this by critically evaluating foundational and current work in these areas, as well as considering how theories and research findings can inform current educational policies and practice.\nThe class will be interactive, with a combination of asynchronous video lectures, podcasts, discussion boards, and synchronous small-group and whole-class discussions.

Taking a broad sociolinguistic approach that incorporates theoretical frameworks such as pragmatics, interactional sociolinguistics, ethnography, Critical Discourse Analysis, and multimodal discourse analysis, students consider the relationship between language and politics from three major perspectives. First, we investigate language use in various genres of political discourse, including speeches, debates, advertising, and print and broadcast media coverage of political events, focusing on how various linguistic features serve to shape political identities and stances. Next, we consider the discursive construction and negotiation of various policy issues (e.g., education, health, immigration), focusing on how these issues are framed by different political parties and stakeholders with divergent interests and ideologies. Finally, we take on the notion of language as a political issue itself, examining topics such as standard and official language movements, the status of language in the construction of national identity, and the role of language planning initiatives in addressing the shifting linguistic ecology of a globalizing world.\r\n\r\nThe course assumes basic familiarity with sociolinguistic principles and works toward refining students&rsquo; critical and analytical abilities in the study of language in its social context.

The course is organized around five regional segments or modules corresponding to the world&rsquo;s major developing areas or regions: \n(i) East Asia; (ii) South Asia; (iii) Sub-Saharan Africa; (iv) Latin America; and (v) the Middle East and North Africa. Under each module, a set of two or three leading development issues are analyzed. \nThese issues are selected with a view to analyzing a particular issue in the context of a region in which that issue is most prominent or challenging. The intention, therefore, is to present each major development issue in stark relief and encourage comparisons and contrasts across regions and countries where appropriate. For example, equity and distributional issues and macroeconomic stabilization are examined against the backdrop of Latin America where these issues have been particularly acute, while economic stagnation, how to initiate and sustain economic growth and aid effectiveness are analyzed in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, how to make growth more pro-poor is studied in South Asia, and the challenges of rebalancing growth, raising productivity and moving up the global value chain are examined in East Asia.

New and innovative socially oriented products and services can increase the standard of living and provide people with opportunities to improve their lives.

Social innovation has also lead to significant improvements in the way businesses operate and has closed the gaps between different markets.\r\n\r\nSocial innovation has become a cornerstone in solving some of the world&rsquo;s most complex social problems. The key to solving these problems is supporting and sustaining systems change. One way this can be accomplished is through a multi-sector approach that incorporates innovation into the entire life cycle of the business, organization, policy or the like. Too often innovation is limited to creating something new as opposed to modifications or adjustments to what is already in existence. Leveraging research and development expertise, coupled with evidence based research and best practice, social innovation can be a powerful tool in solving some of the world&rsquo;s most pressing problems.\r\n\r\nThe course will engage students in understanding the core principles of social innovation and their role as an individual and a member of the larger community.
