In particular, we will focus on how the racialization of the African body at the &ldquo;inauguration of modernity&rdquo; drew both on metaphorical and literal readings of waste. For instance, notions like pungence, impurity, darkness, dirt, emptiness, etc., commonly associated with the African body, situated the African outside the parameters of the &ldquo;Human&rdquo; (Wynter 2003). Descriptions of Africa as &ldquo;the dark continent&rdquo; (Stanley 1878), &ldquo;the heart of darkness&rdquo; (Conrad, 1899), &ldquo;a place without history&rdquo; (Trevor-Roper 1963), &ldquo;the Whiteman&rsquo;s grave&rdquo; (Curtin 1963), to name a few negations (Achebe 1977), created the conditions that racialized the African qua Black body as waste. In the contemporary moment, these negations, which also imagined Africa as an empty continent, a &ldquo;terra nullius&rdquo; or &ldquo;terra incognita&rdquo; (Mudimbe 1987) have spilled over into the recent interplanetary obsession among billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, etc., to discharge &ldquo;waste&rdquo; into space because space is empty. If the African experiment is the foundation on which these extra-terrestrial projects on waste deposition are envisioned, we will discuss how the appearance of the &ldquo;modern human&rdquo; in the western imaginary coincided with the construct of &ldquo;waste.&rdquo; In the era of the European encounter, the incorporation of both the African human and the African continent into Western definitions of the human resulted in their equation or reduction to Waste. Hence, we will distinguish between &ldquo;waste produced by humans&rdquo; and &ldquo;humans produced as waste,&rdquo; a distinction that will show us that human-produced waste, otherwise known as &ldquo;anthropogenic waste,&rdquo; is not produced equally around the globe. For example, between 2000 to 2020, Africa, compared to the rest of the world, contributed only 3.9 percent of carbon emissions (Kamer 2022), making it the least polluting continent yet the most vulnerable paradoxically. These are the key questions we will consider: What intersections between race, class, gender, and history are at play in the production of waste? How does Africa, in general, and the African body in particular, embody the paradox of extraction and deposition? In a world where Africa is figured as a geographical &ldquo;shithole,&rdquo; how significant are these considerations in the pursuit of radical global environmental justice?"}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "45441", "description": "Millions of people in the Sahara-Sahel region have freely opted to migrate or/and have been forced into migration due to many factors including socio-economic deprivation, wars and conflicts, militarization and empire, environmental factors, among many others. This course seeks to provide an introduction to the transnational migration in what has been coined as &ldquo;Europe&rsquo;s Frontier Zone&rdquo; or &ldquo;Europe African borders&rdquo; by highlighting the drivers behind people&#39;s decisions to move from one place to another. Needless to say, human mobility has become one of the most politicized issues of our time as the tension between mobility and containment is a central feature both globally and across the Sahara-Sahel region. The latter has become a key area of externalization and securitization of the European Union&rsquo;s border control mechanisms.

But how much do we really know about political violence in Africa? We will interrogate this question by probing: Who defines &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; and &ldquo;insurgency&rdquo; in Africa? Why do armed groups form and what drives individuals to join them? Why does political violence manifest in different ways? Are terrorism and insurgency effective political tactics? Are current forms of political violence inventions from the modern era, or do they have deeper historical roots? This course will address these and other questions, while introducing students to relevant analytical frameworks, theories, and cases concerning terrorism, insurgency, and related forms of political violence in Africa.

We will explore the formation of institutions such as the League of Nations and the United Nations to understand how neoliberal humanism shapes the formation of nation-states through practices such as forced migration, border policing, occupations, settler colonialism, and the divvying of geographies to ensure the homogeneity of nation-states.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nOur case studies will focus on the SWANA region to study the relationship between colonial and imperial histories, the commodification of culture and difference, the biopoliticization of bodies, and the reconfiguration of geographies through spatial politics and policies. We will examine how the production of nation-states necessitated the homogenization of populations, thus further strengthening the concept of the minority. Our case studies offer an analysis of minority-making in places such as Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Morocco, Egypt, and Turkey. We will explore how the formation of the sectarian governmentality mobilizes different national identities and discourses and how their political implications on the region."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43979", "description": "This course provides a critical introduction to the main paradigms, methods, and approaches that have been used to study the Arab world.

Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran were at the epicenter of the year&rsquo;s history making events whose consequences continue to live among us all. These included the Islamic revolution in Iran in February 1979 and the start of three decades and a half of Iran US tensions, and the execution of an elected Prime Minister by a military dictator in Pakistan setting up the long army rule and process of Islamization. Then came the US hostages crisis in Tehran in November and the burning of the US Embassy in Islamabad, signaling the merger of Pakistani and Iranian anti Americanism that began feeding a broader sentiment against the US in the Muslim world. The year ended however with its most consequential event: the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979.The US-led jihad against the Soviets, assisted by Pakistan, won but ended up as a bittersweet victory as it laid the foundation of a deadly extremist religious infrastructure that started beating to the rhythm of global Islamic revivalism unleashing uncontrollable forces of radicalism. They had a horrendous impact on the region and on the US and global security, the most tragic and visible sign of which was 9/11.The course will look at all these dramatic and history changing developments and their complex intertwining with local, regional and global issues and challenges. It will examine how Pakistan&rsquo;s national vision, embraced by years of authoritarian rule and troubled democracy, rise of religious orthodoxy, and strategic over extension by its ambitious army led to a weak institutional architecture that collided with its domestic tensions, opening up Pakistan to long years of instability and extremism, which only are beginning to be brought under control. The democracy is beginning to stabilize and Pakistan&rsquo;s on going efforts against extremist and militant organizations are proceeding slowly but steadily. How will Prime Minister Imran Khan handle these challenges? The course will study the attempts by Iran to export its revolution, the development of its nuclear program, the challenges Iran posed to the US power in the Middle East and its allies, and the looming strategic shadow of Iran over the region,  especially following the forces of instability released by the unsuccessful Iraq war. And the course will also look at nearly four decades of strained relations between Iran and the US The course will study the just finished war in Afghanistan and the ongoing fight against Al Qaeda, the newly arrived terrorist outfit in Afghanistan-Pakistan border region&mdash;the ISIS-K and its interplay with the Taliban and what role can be played in these conflicts by Pakistan which itself has been a target of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan. It will also look at how Afghanistan has endured one of the most devastating conflicts of our time, while simultaneously struggling with the building of &ldquo;political institutions, structures of governance, (and) vital state institutions&rdquo; and what may lie in store for this country after the return to power of the Taliban who are facing daunting task of addressing the economic free fall of Afghanistan and its security and stabilization challenges after the US withdrawal . Also  how will the Biden administration will cope with the Afghanistan challenge. Another relevant question that the class will analyze includes what roles could Pakistan and the US could play in the stabilization of Afghanistan following the end of America&rsquo;s war there? And finally with the lengthening strategic shadow of China over the region it will be interesting to see what role China may play in the future of Afghanistan. Also interesting to watch will be India&rsquo;s role and that of Iran in this strategic power play likened by some to the ancient Great Game. The Iran nuclear deal has been abrogated by Washington and sanctions re imposed on Iran. It will be interesting to see whether the Biden administration returns to the deal and on what terms specially after the election of a hard line President.

For most of the post-World War II era, sovereign risk was mainly a concern facing creditors to emerging market governments. However, in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008, in some advanced countries government debt has grown to levels only previously seen in wartime while the ongoing COVID pandemic is pushing sovereign debt even higher to historical levels, a trend that has undermined the creditworthiness of governments formerly judged to be of the lowest risk. This course takes the position that deficits and debt matter, although students are welcome to challenge that view. It will provide a multifaceted view of sovereign risk, primarily through the lens of credit rating agency methodologies. It will examine the interplay of economic, institutional, fiscal, financial market and geopolitical factors that influence sovereign credit quality. It will focus on sovereign case studies and\nexamine common features of debt crises&mdash;namely, the 1980s Latin America debt crisis which engulfed the Philippines, the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and the effect of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis on Asian sovereigns. While the focus is on Asia, the course will examine the watershed Greek default and debt crisis of 2009-2018 and a contentious triple-A downgrade of the U.S. government in 2011. The course will also examine the recent rise of China as a major creditor to developing countries as well as the fiscal and economic effects of the COVID pandemic on the creditworthiness of advanced and developing countries. The final project for the course will be in-class oral presentations in the format of a mock sovereign credit rating committee. At the conclusion of the course, students will: (1)\ndevelop an understanding of the evolution of sovereign risk since the 1980s and rise of global bond markets, (2) be conversant on the interplay of factors influencing sovereign credit risk (3) be capable of taking a substantive opinion of relative sovereign credit quality. Grading consists of weekly, short writing assignments and the final project; class participation will be a key factor. This semester, the course will feature one guest lecturer, the head of Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service Macro-Board and former director of their sovereign default analysis work.

For some, it reflects simply a frame for human identity, a notional nation to call home. For others, nationalism represents the mobilization of individuals around the cause of the nation, and can have a far bolder intention. In today&rsquo;s global politics, nationalism is often seen as a reaction to, and hindrance of a globalizing world. In some instances, nationalism is seen as globalism&rsquo;s antidote, while in other instances it reflects a desire to repel or resist the transformative impact of a world increasingly intruding into national communities. In Asia, this concept has had many incarnations. Largely associated with the arrival of Western imperialism, the nation-state seemed an imposter in Asia especially to those who had been educated in the West but who sought to give voice to their culture&rsquo;s identity. From the early decades of the twentieth century, Asia&rsquo;s leaders &ndash; its scholars, its politicians and its military commanders &ndash; have deliberated on this concept of the nation and of their nation&rsquo;s identity in the world. Nationalism in the early twenty-first century Asia seems to be organized around the conflict that redrew the boundaries of Asian societies, and the balance of power that it fostered in its wake. History, and its reimagining, provides ample fodder for Asia&rsquo;s contemporary nationalist impulses. This course will explore the various episodes and advocates of nationalism in Asia.

In this course we will examine the scientific underpinnings of a range of environmental issues that pertain to international agriculture since its invention roughly 12,000 years ago. We will look at topics such as the biological origins of crop plants and domesticated animals, patterns of land conversion and use, soil creation and loss, the use and contamination of water, fertilizer and its impact on nutrient cycling, pesticides and other novel chemicals employed in agriculture, the use of fossil fuels for food transport and processing, food packaging, and the processing of food waste. Some potential solutions to the challenge of global food sustainability will be examined such as the use of GMOs and other biotech approaches, the role of subsidies, energy and water policies, changing diets and food sources, alternate farming practices, and food justice issues.

You will learn how ecological systems are structured, how we rely on them, what we can do to exist in harmony with them, and the consequences of doing otherwise."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "46448", "description": "We live in an era of rapid global change. As humans continue to alter the environment at an unprecedented pace, ecosystems are rearranging themselves and altering the face of infectious disease. In this course, we will first discuss how facets of human development including urbanisation, climate change, and agricultural industrialisation are impacting infectious disease in wildlife and livestock populations.

In this course, we will follow the whole arc of scientific inquiry and engagement &ndash; from project design and sample collection through data generation, analysis, and interpretation. We will partner with university, governmental, and non-profit partners to tackle real-world research questions where answers lie in the microorganisms comprising host-associated and environmental microbiomes. Whether samples derive from salt marsh grasses, soils from our own organic garden, or swabs collected from island foxes, we&rsquo;ll enter the world of microbial ecology and discover something new. In the spring semester, we will take a deep-dive into computational analysis to explore alpha and beta diversity, taxonomic composition, and differential abundance in QIIME2 and create publication-quality figures in RStudio. The semester will culminate in a final report and presentation that contextualizes results in the scientific literature and clearly communicates findings to our collaborating partners."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "32259", "description": "Tutorial research is taken primarily by third year students who wish to begin a research project that may continue on to the senior year as RISE (Research Intensive Senior Experience).
