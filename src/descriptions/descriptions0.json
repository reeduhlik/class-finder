Drawing on a variety of disciplines, we will consider the ways in which class, ethnicity, geography, religion, and culture shape the status, experiences, and desires of women in the region. Moving beyond a focus on women, we will also consider how conceptions of femininity and masculinity are constructed over time, and how in turn these concepts shape ideas about love, family, politics, and appropriate gender relations.

For others, nationalism represents the mobilization of individuals around the cause of the nation, and can have a far bolder intention. In today&rsquo;s global politics, nationalism is often seen as a reaction to, and hindrance of a globalizing world.

Some, like the US, have extensive resources and are able bring to bear a wide range of resources and political influence. Most others, however, struggle to nurse limited national resources and limited political influence. These smaller states often utilize their limited resources in very clever and focused ways to deliver peacemaking outcomes. Often smaller states will fund the peacemaking activities of NGOs or financially support the peacemaking efforts of regional organizations. Of course, these states (great, medium and small) pursue peacemaking objectives in the name of their national interest (however that may be defined). Norway, for example, has supported peace initiatives in Guatemala, Sudan and Sri Lanka. While none of these countries had significant relations with Norway, the Storting (the Norwegian Parliament) funded these initiatives because they were deemed in the national interest. The same may be said of Japanese support for the Aceh peace initiative, as well as a host of others sponsored states around the globe. Arguably, no state is entirely dedicated to peacemaking along. In pursuing national interests some states may pursue peacemaking in one place, and conflict promotion in another.&nbsp;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nIn this course students will have an opportunity to examine a range of case studies that illustrate the peacemaking efforts of smaller states.

Of course in examining any of these cases it will be instructive to ask &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in it&rdquo; for the given state.

In turn, harvesting wild plants and animals and producing domesticated crops and livestock impact the environment and biodiversity. We will explore many fundamental concepts of evolution and ecology, including natural selection, phylogenetics, population biology, plant-animal interactions, nutrient cycling, and climate change in order to better understand the plants, animals, and fungi in our diets.

Junior and Seniors only.\n\nThis course shows what kinds of insight mathematical techniques can give to about biological populations of individuals, communities, and cells. My expectation is that all of you have had a good foundation in biology and some mathematics, but you won&#39;t be expected to remember every detail.

At the heart of this field are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), membrane receptors that account for the largest gene family in the human genome. These receptors also represent the largest class of &ldquo;druggable&rdquo; proteins with ~30% of all currently approved FDA-drugs targeting GPCRs. Moreover, recent discoveries have unveiled novel functions for understudied GPCRs that have shed new light on important physiological processes ranging from blood pressure regulation to wound healing. Using seminal peer-reviewed scientific literature, students in this course will learn the principles of GPCR signaling and their novel functions in health and disease. Topics covered will include opioid receptors as targets for pain management, chemosensors that govern the sensory systems, frizzled receptors that modulate tissue development, and many others. Students enrolled in this course will be expected to utilize critical analytical skills to read, interpret, and present findings from the scientific literature. They will apply these research skills to case studies and learn to effectively communicate their scientific discoveries."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "44486", "description": "\r\n    Topics relating to the molecular and cell biology of cancer will be discussed.

Whether samples derive from salt marsh grasses, soils from our own organic garden, or swabs collected from island foxes, we&rsquo;ll enter the world of microbial ecology and discover something new. In the fall semester, we will design our project in collaboration with this year&rsquo;s partners, collect and inventory samples, extract DNA, and generate 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data to address our questions of interest.
