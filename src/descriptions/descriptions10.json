During the Cold War, the conflict between two ideological systems &mdash; Communism, which the Soviet Union sought to expand, and democracy, which the United States has used to counter Communism &mdash; has led to a number of direct and indirect clashes between these two superpowers, including wars in Vietnam and Korea, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Berlin Blockade, and the creation of the Berlin Wall. The collapse of the Communist system, along with the perception of the &ldquo;End of History,&rdquo; spread a feeling of optimism about U.S.-Russian relations.\n\nOriginally, optimism strengthened due to initially amicable relations between the Russian and U.S. presidents. However, subsequent relations took a wrong turn and went through a downward spiral, worsening after each crisis (including the NATO bombings of Yugoslavia, the Color Revolutions in the post-Soviet space, Russia&rsquo;s wars with Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria in 2008, 2014, and 2015, respectively, Russia&rsquo;s interference in the U.S. elections in 2016 and Russia&rsquo;s ongoing 2022 war in Ukraine). As of today, U.S.-Russian relations are at the lowest point since the end of the Cold War. Many observers wonder to what extent such an outcome was inevitable and who is to blame for it.\n\nThis course will address this and related questions in depth by analyzing the foreign policy between the U.S. and Russia. We will cover U.S.-Russian foreign policy, Russian geopolitics, the influence of Marxist-Leninist theory, the Cold War, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia&rsquo;s foreign policy under Putin, and the recent U.S. responses to Russia&rsquo;s assertive behavior on the international stage. We will also reflect on the future of the U.S.-Russian relations.

Simultaneously, military action on the eastern flank of the region in the South Caucasus has involved Russia and at times Turkey decisively. Both Moscow and Ankara have also competed for influence in the region&rsquo;s western flank where the conflicts among the successor states of the former Yugoslavia continue to smolder, fanned by disinformation campaigns, foreign political manipulation, and attempted coup d&rsquo;etats. The region is crisscrossed by critical energy, commodity, and transportation networks which have been suppressed by inter-state conflict. Nationalism and conflicting historical narratives compete as former imperial spheres have been resurrected while uncertainty about future membership in the European Union or NATO perpetuates a security dilemma. The course methodology combines an education in foreign policy practice with academic analysis of geographic, economic, historical, military, ideological, and cultural regional factors to ask: What kind of Greater Black Sea region is likely to emerge from the conclusion of the War in Ukraine?

Further, the way health systems and larger political systems are structured directly impact the ability to prepare for, manage, and respond to, large scale public health threats. The failure to act has implications not just on health, but on the daily lives and the economy of a system. Yet, preparation, management, and response &ndash; both at the national and international level &ndash; bears political, financial, and arguably, individual, costs. The pandemic has painfully highlighted this systemic under-resourcing of health systems, as well as the reality that common multilateral financial responses are incommensurate with the need and health burden at hand. This then leads to critical questions in international and national health system development: how are health systems financed? Who pays and how much?

This course bridges the gap between theory and practice, encouraging students to examine the role of intelligence organizations in government and how the secrecy surrounding intelligence contributes to, and challenges, national security and transparency in governance.  While the primary focus will be on the American intelligence system, the course addresses comparative issues in the study of intelligence, including themes and examples that transcend particular national and political contexts.\n \nThis course will introduce students to fundamental issues in intelligence studies, including the role of intelligence in national security decision-making, elements of intelligence success and failure, and oversight.  Class participants will gain a working understanding of the different types of intelligence, the range of responsibilities that elements of an intelligence community hold, and the relationship between intelligence and the policy-making process. Beyond technical aspects of intelligence functions, students will explore the political context that frames intelligence operations, evaluating how intelligence information relates to high-level government decision-making and to the conduct of foreign policy.  Finally, students will consider some of the major normative questions regarding intelligence, such as: what the appropriate role for intelligence should be in a democracy, how transparent intelligence should be to the public, and how its vast array of activities should be supervised.\n  \nCourse Format\nThis course is a seminar; the course is formatted to facilitate student-driven learning.

Science and technology are increasingly critical to national security, and national security concerns will increasingly shape the scientific enterprise. Policymakers must develop the knowledge, best practices, and tools to help advance scientific research, promote technologies that help solve urgent global challenges, and safeguard the fundamental values at the heart of the social contract. Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and advanced computing, biotechnologies and biomanufacturing, communication and networking technologies, and renewable energy generation and storage are poised to transform decision making from the boardroom to the battlefield. Policymakers must not only adapt to this new strategic environment, but also anticipate the most salient trends and shape them accordingly. \n &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nIn many ways, technology statecraft today is more complex and cross-cutting than in the past. It is not just governments that matter but also private companies, academic researchers, philanthropies, and state and local governments who are funding, inventing, and deploying cutting-edge technology. Intensifying geopolitical competition and rapid advances in science and technology require policymakers to employ an array of tools to influence the design, development, and deployment of critical and emerging technologies. Leaders must operate at the seams of foreign and domestic policy, balance national security and economic priorities, and integrate diverse perspectives across foundational sectors of our societies. They must devise policy under conditions of limited resources and mounting transnational challenges, while also navigating growing strategic competition among the major powers. Tradeoffs and tensions are inevitable, but the demand for wise policy and strategy leadership is indispensable. \n &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThis course is organized in three parts. First, we will explore the tools that protect sensitive technologies and slow down competitors: export controls, investment screening, and economic sanctions. Next, we will grapple with the tools that promote technological innovation and help nations run faster: investments in research and development, support for public-private partnerships, and greater government action around a modern industrial and innovation strategy. Finally, we will consider the tools that project influence, foster greater technology situational awareness, and enable the rapid adoption of new capabilities: diplomacy and arms control, international technical standards, and horizon scanning of the global science and technology landscape.

Working from items as diverse as the circulation of conspiracy theories about covert powers that control governments, to rumors about state activity designed to undermine various groups, to beliefs about cataclysmic end times and the impact these have in specific geo-political contexts, students in this course will engage in analytic and research approaches to popularly-held belief. Rather than debate or debunk these narratives, course participants will consider contemporary legends and popular myths as a communal fact-finding process and examine popular belief systems as sites of alternate epistemologies and resistance that may or may not undermine dominant systems of power and security.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe second part of the course will consider disinformation that originates from the top down, or fake news. This portion of the course will consider information/disinformation efforts that involve government, entertainment, and media elites. Working from a variety of historic and contemporary examples, participants will consider the various tools available to those in power to further disinformation, with a particular emphasis on how the evolving social media context enhances information operations. Students will consider the erosion of elite credibility and mainstream journalism, phantoms/bogeymen and their use in electoral processes, ideological warfare disguised as information, and how propaganda and disinformation operations support or undermine existing power and security systems."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43826", "description": "\r\n    The course on Conflict Resolution and Mediation is based on the premise that conflict resolution in both professional and personal settings is essential for forging successful relationships between people, communities, organizations, and countries. Conflict is an inherent part of our social experience and present at all levels of our interactions, from interpersonal to intergroup and international. Conflict can be violent and destructive -- or spur creativity, leading to positive outcomes that benefit all stakeholders.\nThe course seeks to cultivate theoretical understanding about the root causes of conflict, which are typically rooted in competing claims, and explore practical remedies between parties in dispute. It provides information on the dynamics of conflict and seeks to develop skills that can be used to transform conflict into an opportunity for personal growth, building common ground, opening lines of communication, and fostering mutual understanding through contact, communication and cooperation.\nThe course includes three components: (i) theory/practice, (ii) case studies, and a (iii) diplomatic simulation. It profiles actual conflicts as prototypes for understanding and addressing disputes. Awareness and skills cultivated through the course are also considered in the context of actual world events where conflict has occurred.\nThe course culminates with a diplomatic simulation where information is presented on a conflict with the potential to escalate into deadly violence.

Part I focuses on state-society relations and state consolidation in pre-modern South Asia. In this section, we survey the diverse societies of the South Asia region; the efforts of prior states and empires&mdash;including the Mughals, the British, various Afghan kings, and 20th century states&mdash;to rule these societies; and the administrative and security challenges that modern South Asia has inherited from this past. Part II focuses on resistance to state power in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka. We explore the root causes of insurgencies in these countries, considering variables such as political and economic grievances, ideology, external sponsorship, rent-seeking, and military occupation. We also consider the role of Islamic extremist militants across the region, and their sponsors.

The beginning of wisdom with regard to force planning, then, is to approach the subject with a certain amount of modesty and a measure of respect for its complexity.\r\nThe aim of this course is threefold:\r\n. To show students what force planning encompasses, how it has been done in the United States, and how it should be done\r\n. To help students who wish to engage professionally in one or more aspects of force planning to do so effectively\r\n. To allow all students become more sophisticated observers and critics of defense strategy and planning efforts, products, and decisions.\r\nStudents who participate in this course should expect to learn about the following:\r\n. What force planning is and is not, and what its relationship is to other aspects of defense and national security policy making\r\n. A coherent conceptual framework that integrates all of the major factors that must be considered in determining the nation&#39;s defense program\r\n. Primary intellectual and analytical techniques used in applying that framework\r\n. Key issues facing defense policy makers today and how those issues likely will shape U.S. military forces and U.S. national security in the future."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43667", "description": "\r\n    Cybercrime &ndash; criminal activity dependent on or enabled by computers &ndash; poses an ever-evolving threat to our national security, economic interests, public safety, and societal trust.

Digital Forensics encompasses the recovery, investigation, examination, and (most of all) analysis of material found on digital devices. This discipline varies from eDiscovery, in the sense that not only are we looking to provide the information in order to further investigations, but to understand the information to tell the story of what happened on the device and the actions of the user. It is not simply the acquisition of forensic artifacts, but the knowledge to explain artifacts.

From ISIS&#39; terrorist narrative before the courts of law? From news emerging from Ukraine? Do ground investigations have the capacity to reveal the crimes against women, or are they choosing not to? This course will investigate these questions, especially taking into account the field investigations of Fr. Patrick Desbois and his team. Students will learn how to conduct forensic investigations of violence against women in the scope of genocide and mass crimes. The course is co-taught by Fr.

It advances and assesses three arguments. First, gender is conceptually and theoretically necessary to thinking about security itself and central questions of security, to include war, conflict, and peace. Second, gender is indispensable in explaining the complex cause-and-effect relationships over a range of security issues. And, third, gender is important from the policy standpoint for devising sustainable and effective approaches for making the world a more secure place for everyone, regardless of their social identity. By engaging the UN Women Gender and Security Toolkit as an organizing concept, the course proceeds through a series of topics dedicated to security sector governance, military, defense and gender, security sector reforms and gender, justice, and gender, law enforcement and gender, border management and gender, and intersectionality of gender with other social markers, such as race and social class. By highlighting the complexities of integrating the findings of gender studies into policy, the course will be of interest to both practitioners and students of security studies, gender studies, and IR in general."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "38526", "description": "\r\n    The course examines the neurobiology of stress, trauma, and resilience, so that students can understand how their body and mind are wired to perceive information and make decisions while challenged or threatened. We will examine habit patterns, both perceptual and behavioral, and explore how these habits can be changed to allow for more accurate situational awareness, less biased decision-making, more capacity to interrupt impulsive or reactive decisions, more intentionality, and more capacity to access choice. After exploring these topics at the individual and interpersonal levels, we will apply these topics to human organizations and systems. We will explore how organizations and systems are &ldquo;enacted&rdquo; through organizational habits; how they manage stress, anxiety, uncertainty and insecurity; and how they learn, adapt, and change (or not). This part of the course will draw out policy implications in the realm of national and international security. We will rely on a month-long group project to explore these dynamics in a case study at the end of the semester.\nThis course alternates between periods of intellectual learning and discussion, periods of experiential engagement with mind-body practices, and reflective discussion about those practices.

Discussion will include the various institutions and actors that the US and, to a lesser extent, other governments have used to promote economics as a complement to military operations. It also addresses the effects of war on the macroeconomic conditions in belligerent nations, both in a particular country (e.g. Iraq, Syria, or Afghanistan), and on US government spending and the US economy. It will address the economic nature of warfare to include contractors, private military security companies, and the challenges of corruption.

The study of seapower is essential to understanding the origins, the pathways, and the consequences of these maritime interactions. This course will assess the role of seapower in shaping the Indo-Pacific security environment. In this class, students will first learn about the classical and contemporary theories of seapower and seapower&rsquo;s influence upon Asia&rsquo;s modern history. The course will study how aspiring maritime powers, such as China and India, have introduced new uncertainties and opportunities to regional and global security. The class will then examine how established seafaring nations, including the United States and Japan, have responded to changing strategic circumstances as rising powers turn to the seas.

From Syria and Iraq, they used ISIS as a convenient cover story for mounting air, land, and sea operations against US and US-led coalition forces.  All sides have carefully avoided defining these kinetic engagements a hot war. The same has rung true of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Eastern Ukraine in 2014 and annexation of Crimea in 2015.  US and coalition personnel on the front lines from the Black Sea to the Levant, therefore, have confronted Russian and Iranian ordinance without commensurate rules of engagement, authorities, or weapons.  Tehran and Moscow have made abundantly clear that they are digging in; they show no signs of withdrawing to their respective borders.  Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon, meanwhile, have watched instability grow along their sovereign borders and shorelines as they have welcomed, housed, educated, and cared for millions of refugees who fled war-torn Syria and Iraq. The prolonged humanitarian refugee crises remain unresolved.\n &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nTurkey&#39;s unique geography, military readiness, and counterterrorism experience are three strong reasons the US needs Ankara to play a coordinated and productive role in safeguarding and defending NATO&rsquo;s southeastern flank from Russia, Iran, and terrorist groups. In a region, however, where &ldquo;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&rdquo; is a common strategy, Ankara is exercising a strategic pause &ndash; as its Ottoman ancestors did &ndash; as a tool to weigh its options.  The &ldquo;Turkish Pause&rdquo; does not mean inactivity. From 2015 to 2021, Ankara flagrantly flirted with Moscow and Tehran as a means to assess her opportunities; she gauged reactions from Washington and European capitals; and the Turkish government took time to recalculate and announce decisions.  As the Young Turks learned in the lead-up to and during WWI and WWII, Turkey has power when its geography is in play. While Turkey joined NATO nearly 70 years ago, US and Brussels need to recognize that they are in an existential head-to-head competition with Russia and Iran. If Washington does not play to win &ndash; Moscow and Tehran will extract even more unearned advantages.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nHow did we get here? What defines modern hot wars and terrorism? What constitutes an alliance? How do we regain dominance in a region that 19th century diplomats called &ldquo;The Eastern Question?&rdquo;  What policies, strategies, and courses of action will reset the shot clock? Five key issues complicate short- and long-term answers to US policy options and engagement strategies with Turkey.  Students will explore strategies that aim to address each of them.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&bull;   First, Turkey has acquired Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missiles that pose direct threats to NATO F-35 and other aircraft as well as other NATO assets and personnel in the region.  While this is not the first time Turkey has flirted with Russia - and not the first time the US has closed the door to arms sales - it is the first time NATO has had to confront Russian air, land, and sea forces that are now based in Syria under long-term agreements. \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&bull;   Second, the US decision in the 2010s to train, arm, and advise Syrian-based Kurdish People&rsquo;s Protection Units (YPG) so that they could help drive ISIS from its &ldquo;self-proclaimed&rdquo; caliphate in Raqqa and challenge Bashar al-Assad drew immediate and sustained reactions from Turkey because at least some YPG members were affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers&rsquo; Party (PKK). This issue remains largely unresolved, and it is an unrelenting source of high and enduring tension in the region.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&bull;   Third, while formal US policy supports a unity Iraq, the US has walked a tight rope with Ankara each time the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government (and its predecessors) has attempted to gain more autonomy or independence from Baghdad (1970, 1991, 2005 and 2017).  Sustained US diplomatic, military, and intelligence relations with the IRG have exacerbated mistrust in Ankara.  Adding to these turbulent waters are historic and ongoing ties between the PUK and KDP with the PKK and with Iran. \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&bull;   Fourth, the prolonged wars in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, along with instability in Lebanon, have created opportunities for Iran and Hizballah to exert military and sectarian &ldquo;soft power&rdquo; influence well beyond its borders.  Turkey, home to the last Sunni Caliphate, has complained about growing Shia activism.  The broader NATO alliance has struggled to adapt to Iran&rsquo;s expanding power in the Middle East &ndash; and its nuclear weapons ambitions that are accelerating. \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&bull;   Fifth, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has jailed at least 100,000 government employees, journalists, scholars, and protesters who have questioned his policies, corruption, and ruling style.  He remains convinced - without credible evidence - that the USG worked behind the scenes with Pennsylvania-based Fethullah G&uuml;len to inspire or support the July 2016 failed coup attempt.  The US has not been successful in countering Turkey&rsquo;s propaganda and harmful narrative on this point in part because of credible analytic judgments that, according to US Ambassador Jim Jeffrey, point clearly to G&uuml;len.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThis class uses two teaching methods. Before the mid-term, students will learn about key historic events and apply them to current issues that unfold during the semester.  After the mid-term paper, students will apply what they have learned while playing assigned roles as the DNI/DCIA or the Secretaries of State, Defense, and Treasury.

We are currently witnessing an accelerating shift in traditional power centers, and nation-states are no longer the only significant players. In fact, their power is seeping away as new centers of influence expand and flex their muscles in an increasingly complex global environment. In a world that was once separated and contained by national boundaries and loyalties, a new cast of actors is aggressively determining outcomes based on motivations, capabilities, and actions that may have little in common with the goals of governments.  While nation-states and their leaders continue to retain immense authority, Multinational Corporations (MNCs) now routinely circumvent governments to accomplish their goals. This shift in power centers has the potential to cause friction and could work against stated geopolitical objectives. Understanding this new environment is critical to achieving success within the frameworks of national security, international relations, politics, and economics.\n &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThis course is designed to examine the historical role private companies have played in United States foreign policy, the current questions surrounding the integration of Multinational Corporations in international relations and national security, and a look toward the future. It is essential that the next generation of policymakers understand the impact of MNCs and the balance that is needed as the integration continues.

Stretching ourselves requires new approaches &ndash; not reading the same, old texts, or using the same, old methodologies and theories. It is primarily for this reason &ndash; the need for imaginative, strategic leaders &ndash; that this class uses fiction as the launching point for discussion.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nUsing fiction as a springboard will hone several key student skills. First, although creativity may (or may not) be able to be taught, brain science suggests that our brains can change with practice to see challenges in new ways (e.g., neuroplasticity). Second, fiction almost insures that the focus remains on the learning objectives and key questions rather than on the method used (the case study, for instance) to explore those areas. Instead of fighting a scenario, suspending disbelief creates a healthy adragodgical environment. Third, the ability to quickly identify symbols is important at the tactical through the strategic level. Fourth, students who read fiction also tend to be able to better empathize, an important lesson that Secretary Robert MacNamera learned as he notes in the movie, &ldquo;Fog of War.&rdquo; Being introduced to strange cultures or experiences, a fifth benefit, will serve the future strategist well in providing heretofor unseen challenges and potential solutions. Sixth, good fiction includes ambiguity, contradictions, complexity, and ambivalence &ndash; just as the real world includes these factors, especially in something as complex as national security and joint warfare. Yes, strategy is about decision-making, but this leads to a seventh point: as Diane Maye, a former Air Force officer and an associate member of the Military Writers Guild, notes, strategy is also &ldquo;the art of outmanuevering other humans.&rdquo; The better we understand human complexity, arguably the better our strategies. By reading fiction, we put human agency back into decision-making. Finally, students will emerge from this course changed readers &ndash; better able to deconstruct (and reconstruct) text, think critically about what is read, and know when, and when not to, apply these frameworks.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nDo not be fooled that this class will be easy because we are reading fiction. As How to Read Literature Like a Professor states, we will engage in reading like a &ldquo;full-contact sport; we crash up against the wave of words with all of our intellectual, imaginative, and emotional resources&rdquo; (82). In doing so, we will debate &ldquo;big&rdquo; (e.g., what separates human warfare from other types of violence, if anything? what of the killing off another species to make way for the human race?) and &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; (e.g., does civilian control equate to more or less violence? how could US democratic processes be destroyed or circumvented by the military? would US national security priorities change if we were a theocracy?) questions. Perhaps most importantly, students will hone their ability to ask the right questions &ndash; a prerequisite to finding least bad options, which is increasingly their job as they move up the chain of command and into higher leadership positions."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43671", "description": "\r\n    During the last decade, the Arctic has been transformed from a scientific backwater to a key strategic area for the United States.

In the context of this abruptly evolving strategic environment, the course will cover emerging opportunities in energy, shipping, and mineral extraction as well as challenges such as maintaining effective domain awareness, border security, human displacement, food security, drug trafficking, and national sovereignty claims between allies and competitors of the United States. The course material will be covered from a variety of perspectives including high-level diplomats, government officials, indigenous leaders, law enforcement officers, military leaders, and managers of multi-national corporations. Students will work to solve emergent problems through coursework and a capstone project that will require innovative, multi-disciplinary thinking.

Policy analysts and practitioners need not be statisticians, but they must be able to interpret data, calculate descriptive statistics, and understand the results of statistical models. Our classes will cover the mathematical building blocks but also focus heavily on research design, when to apply statistical techniques, how to translate regression outputs, and the assumptions and limitations of quantitative analysis. This will include assessing the generalizability and validity of arguments presented in articles that rely on statistical analysis.\n\n\nIn the first few weeks of the course, we will use tools, including Excel and Stata, to explore data &ndash; measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, and data distributions. Then, we will discuss probability &ndash; a fundamental tool for statistical sampling and hypothesis testing. When we cover sampling and hypothesis testing, we will focus on practical applications: when practitioners should use these tools and how to establish a sampling frame, set up fair tests, and determine sample size, for example. Of course, students will also learn the mathematical and computing techniques necessary to design and pull basic samples, produce estimates based on their results, and conduct hypothesis tests. During the final three weeks, students will learn when linear regression is appropriate, the assumptions researchers make when they use linear regression, how to interpret regression outputs and statistical tables, how to diagnose problems within linear regressions, the importance of replicability in research, the debate over p-values, and the basics of experimental design. This section will not require students to calculate regression by hand; instead, more than any other aspect of the course, it will focus on theory.

Sanctions bureaus have proliferated across the Executive Branch, and today most major law firms, corporations, and business consultancies maintain robust sanctions compliance departments. How did we get here? In 1808, Thomas Jefferson noted that when confronted with foreign threats, &quot;three alternatives alone are to be chosen from. 1. embargo. 2. war. 3. submission &amp; tribute.&quot; More than 200 years later, these remain our choices. And when America is unwilling to go to war or submit to foreign impositions, Jefferson&rsquo;s &ldquo;embargo&rdquo;--what we today call economic sanctions--invariably emerges as the policy of choice. This course will explore how the sanctions tool has evolved, becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequently America&#39;s policy of first resort. It will look at how sanctions have been applied in recent cases, to include Iran, Cuba, South Africa, Russia, and China. It also will explore innovations in sanctions, in particular financial sanctions, which derive their power from the U.S. dollar&#39;s role as the world&#39;s reserve currency, and secondary sanctions, which seek to compel persons and entities beyond the jurisdiction of the United States to conform their conduct to U.S. policy."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "42166", "description": "\r\n    America&rsquo;s air weapon is dangerously alluring, because to America&rsquo;s political leaders it is a quick and low-cost solution to any international crisis.

They are also accustomed to three decades of American air dominance, with the Air Force quickly seizing control of enemy skies. US strategic competitors have studied this record of success, however, developing a range of anti-access/area-denial capabilities to contest control of the air. Now for the first time in decades, the United States is not assured of uncontested air supremacy. New threats are also emerging, with more small states and even non-state actors employing missiles and drones to deadly effect. At the same time, new and emerging technologies&mdash;robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and additive manufacturing&mdash;are dramatically changing the future of air warfare. Accordingly, this course addresses three key questions: 1) how effective is airpower as a military instrument for achieving US strategic and political objectives? 2) Will the US be able to continue to control the skies in future wars? 3) What is the future of air warfare?

In the late twentieth century, the region was characterized by the triangular relationship between Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia.  In more recent years, with Iraq in disarray, the Saudi-Iran rivalry has dominated the region, although smaller Gulf powers, such as the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, have increasingly asserted themselves in the regional system.  Moreover, the Gulf has almost always seen substantial external intervention.  Prior to 1971, Britain was the external hegemon; in more recent decades, that role has been played by the United States.  Various Gulf states have also established important relationships with other external powers in recent years, particularly China and Israel.

Researchers must limit their topics, pose relevant questions, define their concepts, formulate testable hypotheses, develop means of measuring variables, design samples, and decide how to collect information. The course begins with an overview of the nature of scientific research (including both product and process) and a discussion of the ethics in conducting human subject research, and the dilemmas inherent in efforts to describe social reality. We then review issues related to posing research questions and selecting methods of data collection, such as variables, units of analysis, hypotheses, and establishing causality.

Sociologists can and do study each of these areas as a relatively separate--yet still socially &quot;imbedded&quot;--domain of activity that can be understood both in terms of its own internal patterns and dynamics and in terms of its dynamic relationships with the broader society.  Such is the intent of this course:  to examine science and the behavior of scientists in those internal and external social contexts.  \nThe course therefore will be a survey of systematic attempts to describe and understand science as an institution.  After a brief survey of the sociology of knowledge, we will critically consider the relation of scientific activities to the other social identities of scientists, such as age, ethnicity, class, and other identities. We will pay especially close attention to gender-issues in science. We will then study the social and cultural organization of the scientific community itself, including the laboratory setting where science is done; the social organization of scientists into departments and &quot;invisible colleges;&quot; the cultural standards, rewards, and ambivalences of scientists; and the manner in which &quot;scientific revolutions&quot; occur (or not) in various fields.  Finally, we will examine how the relations between science and the rest of the social order can nurture or inhibit its institutional advances, such as the interdependences (or not) between that field and the economy, the state, religion, and so forth. Especially in this latter section of the course, but not only here, we will draw on comparative or historical materials, not just studies of American science.  (Detailed topical concerns are outlined below, at the beginning of the subsections of the syllabus.)  All of these might reasonably be described as &ldquo;classic&rdquo; themes in the traditional sociology of science.\nThe field that we study in this course has changed. Throughout most of the history of the Sociology of Science (fairly said to have been founded by Robert K. Merton in the 1930s), sociologists have tended to &ldquo;black-box&rdquo; scientific findings: they treat them as givens, as sound knowledge secured by methods that sociologists and others need not inspect (too) closely. Since the 1970s, there has arisen a &ldquo;deeper&rdquo; view, alternately termed the &ldquo;Strong Program(me)&rdquo; in the Sociology of Science or SSK (The Sociology of Scientific Knowledge). This viewpoint has both feminist and postmodern components, the latter often done by persons working out of a &ldquo;cultural studies&rdquo; perspective. In some of their more assertive writings, scientific knowledge is treated quite skeptically, at times viewed as nothing more than an &ldquo;agreement constructed in a laboratory.&rdquo; We will read several contributions from this literature (to which there are also responses from the classic sociology of science). But I think it only fair to give working scientists themselves a chance to answer such fundamental assertions about their disciplinary expertise, and hence we will read selections from a key work such as Higher Superstition, or related writings, where the scientists themselves read and respond to that literature, in many of its variants."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "40420", "description": "\r\n    Sociology Core Topic: Education is a complex social institution that is responsible for a wide-range of individual and societal outcomes.

But as foreign demand fades, Asia&rsquo;s developing nations must ratchet up local consumer demand to sustain growth, jobs, and incomes. Striking a new balance between work and consumption, between labor and leisure poses new challenges for institutions such as families, schools, churches, and states. This course looks to the growth and significance of affluence, the changing meaning of work, and emerging consumer identities in East Asian capitalism.\r\n\r\nTheories of class and state, consumerism, modernity and post-modernity will provide direction for student papers and class discussions.

Similarly, we will work with concepts of Pierre Bourdieu on cultural capital and taste. We also discuss George Ritzer&rsquo;s insights on how reason and emotion are reshaping consumerism.

The debate on women&rsquo;s nature also constitutes a major conflict in the medieval literary arena, which not only theorizes femininity, but masculinity as well. In this course, we will survey a cross-section of literary works that are emblematic of these deep preoccupations with the construction and representation of gender and sexuality. Through our readings we will follow the debate and the anxiety about gender identity and performance that it reveals across genres, paying particular attention to its influence on Romance. Throughout, we will consider the extent to which contemporary feminist, queer, poststructuralist, and psychoanalytic theories can help us to understand medieval constructions of femininity, masculinity, and sexuality."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "45566", "description": "\r\n    In this course, we will explore the cultural production of the Atlantic as an imagined and material space throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth-centuries. We will also consider how that production has reverberated in the last few decades in discussions of historical memory and national identity, particularly in Spain. Comparing the seafaring adventure tales that produced the Atlantic space for European and elite criollo audiences in the Americas to narratives produced by enslaved people and cimarrones, among other topics, we will explore the geographical and political tensions that arise out of the stories people tell of themselves and their communities. At the same time, we will explore the critical consequences of positing transatlantic, diasporic, and other transnational frames as the basis for (re)thinking identity. The primary historical focus will be on the late colonial relationship between Spain and Cuba, but the critical texts and theory we study will cover a wider Atlantic frame.

Partnerships within and across these sectors are becoming increasingly important.\r\n\r\nWhile the primary focus of this course is corporate practices, all sectors &ndash; business, government and civil society - must collaborate at a greater level for both economic and social progress to occur, and for large-scale, long-term social change."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "41985", "description": "\r\n    The proliferation of data, cheap storage capacity, and powerful tools for extracting information from data cannot only enhance a firm&rsquo;s bottom line but also benefit society at large. However, as with all advanced technologies, this comes with the potential of misuse. Adequate controls regarding the collection, storage, and use of data are needed to ensure that firms do not only achieve business success and comply with the law but also adhere to ethical norms. This course starts with providing a basic understanding of how domestic and international rules and regulations shape the legal framework within which firms use data analytics, and discusses why it is important for firms to go beyond these minimum requirements and adhere to their ethical obligations. Subsequently, the course discusses how firms can implement data governance practices that help them make value-based data-driven decisions. Regarding the latter, the course discusses various techniques that help firms make data-driven decisions that are not only robust and explainable but also free of human bias."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43390", "description": "\r\n    The proliferation of data, cheap storage capacity, and powerful tools for extracting information from data cannot only enhance a firm&rsquo;s bottom line but also benefit society at large.

This course enables students to more effectively conceive and architect solutions that meet customer needs or respond to market opportunities while reducing validation and verification risk. This is a highly interactive graduate level course that leverages engaged lectures and a group project that students pursue in small teams (3 to 5 students per team, as a function of class size). This course provides students with a disciplined approach for formulating a customer or stakeholder need/opportunity and translating this understanding into a solution or response concept through a highly iterative process of prototyping and concept development. Ultimately, the students will translate this solution approach into a set of specifications for a system or service that meets the need/opportunity. The focus initially is on developing an outside-in view that treats the system as a black box, without regard to the components from which it will be built. The course emphasizes the distinction between an operational need/opportunity and a system solution, and stresses the importance of understanding the customer/stakeholder need before converging to a solution. The course helps students understand how to think through the choices at each step of the process. What decisions have to be made? What factors should be considered in making them? It is the answers to these questions that make for good systems thinking when formulating a response strategy to an operational shortfall or opportunity, not just adherence to a standard process.
