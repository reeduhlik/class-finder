A highly resilient community can withstand considerable disruption before undergoing long-&shy;?term change.\r\n\r\nRecovery &ndash; the community&rsquo;s ability to pull through or bounce back to its pre-&shy;?disaster state. A highly resilient community returns to its pre-&shy;?disaster state, or moves beyond that, quicker than a less resilient community.\r\n\r\nCreativity &ndash; the community&rsquo;s ability to build on lessons of a crisis or disaster, to gain an improved level of functioning and increased levels of resilience. A highly resilient community will adapt to its new circumstances and learn from the disaster experience.\r\n\r\nThis online course is designed to assist graduate students working in the area of social work, community development, and public health to understand and apply concepts of resilience to building the capacity of communities to successfully weather disasters whether naturally occurring or manmade. How do planners measure, foster, organize, evaluate and implement the tools, processes and programs that seek to foster resiliency in urban communities? Particular attention will be paid to the role of community-&shy;?level initiatives aimed at educating graduate students to think critically at how a community can prepare for, cope with, and recover from the adverse social, health and community impacts of disasters through the interrelated domains of prevention, preparedness, response and recovery with the end goal of achieving resilience. Emphasis will also be on identifying federal, state, local, private sector and non-&shy;?governmental agency plans to enhance community resilience for health security threats and describe options for building community resilience."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "44033", "description": "\r\n    Introduction to the chemistry of the environment.

Confucianism starts with a challenge to each and every person to improve themselves and to extend the scope of their moral concern from themselves and their immediate family and friends to neighbors, society, and eventually the world at large. The ultimate aim is to move from the individual to &ldquo;all under heaven&rdquo; and bring peace, prosperity, and happiness to all.\n\nIn this class we shall ask, how accurate, plausible, and complete are the theories of human nature that underlie the ethical thought of different Confucian philosophers? Do such theories find any support from the best psychology and cognitive neuroscience of our day? Moreover, are the normative moral claims Confucians derive from their theories of human nature universally valid, merely one variation among many possible forms of society and culture, or without any normative force (i.e. incapable of justifying the moral claims they make)?\n\nIn order to achieve the ends described in the previous paragraph, this course will describe, analyze, and evaluate the theories of the two most important early followers of Kongzi (Confucius): Mengzi (Mencius) and Xunzi from the perspective of both modern science and comparative philosophy.

Ovid had long been a very successful elegiac poet and represented himself as a most skilled praeceptor amoris, &ldquo;teacher of love&rdquo;. But at the apex of the Principate, the new political regime established in Rome by \r\nOctavian Augustus, Ovid decided to partake in the rhetoric surrounding the new socio-political and cultural reality by responding to Vergil&rsquo;s Aeneid, which had just become a &ldquo;classic&rdquo; in the 1st century BC. Vergil re-founded Latin literature in such a way that anyone aspiring to take a seat at the table of canonical authors had to confront and deal \r\nwith the formal and ideological aspects of his epic poem. Ovid did so in his own way, as he never abandoned his wittiness, ambiguity, and literary resourcefulness, on account of which his materials stand out from the entire classical canon and have made him one recognizable, and very often extensively imitated, model for writers from both his own time and posterity. Among many revolutionary aspects of his work is the very choice of myth, and in particular stories of transformation, as the poem&rsquo;s main theme, with a very complex and sometimes elusive web of interconnections among stories serving as its structure.

Yet, at no time in history have the media been more pervasive and integral to campaigns than during the present era. The 2016 presidential election pushed the boundaries of trends that have been evolving in the new media era. Horserace coverage, controversy, and scandal have become well-established characteristics of electoral communication. The media agenda in 2016 was hijacked by stories based on incendiary tweets, rumors, quarrels, and campaign intrigue, as social media use by candidates, the press, and the public rose to unprecedented levels. &ldquo;Fake news&rdquo; stories based on exaggerated facts or outright fabrications proliferated throughout the campaign. These trends have led political observers, such as Ralph Keyes and Susan Glasser, to lament that American society has entered a post-truth era where objective facts are subordinate to emotional appeals and personal beliefs in shaping public opinion.\n\nThis course will examine current trends in American election media. It will unpack the factors underpinning the evolution of political media, and contemplate future developments. A number of core questions form the foundation for the course: Historically, what role have media played in American election campaigns? What role should election media play? How do election media promote or diverge from democratic ideals? In what ways do recent developments in American campaign media help or hinder the democratic process? Finally, is there a better way to conduct elections?\n\nRecent innovations in campaign media have significant implications for the contesting of elections. New media have added an important and evolving dimension to election campaigns. The 2008 presidential election was a watershed in campaign media, as novel election communication techniques, such as the use of social networking sites and online video, proliferated. The 2012 election witnessed greater sophistication in the use of these communication tools. New media offer unprecedented opportunities for voters to become active participants in elections. They are attractive options for young people seeking to engage in campaigns. At the same time, traditional campaign media, especially television coverage and advertising, have maintained their status as primary sources of information for many voters. Reliance on legacy media persisted in 2016, as a majority of voters depended on cable news for election coverage even as their use of social media escalated.\n\nThe course will focus heavily on media in American presidential elections, and it will address media in lower level campaigns. It also will explore election media in a comparative context. We begin with an historical examination of the media/election nexus. We will track the evolution of election media from the era of the partisan press to the current period which is characterized by an almost overwhelming amount of information disseminated via a diverse array of communication platforms. The majority of the course will deal with present day election media. We will discuss the ways in which the structure of the American electoral process, as well as the laws and rules governing campaigns, shape media coverage, candidate strategies, and citizen access and contributions to election information. We will investigate the influence of political parties and campaign finance laws on the media/election process. Specific types of election media will be examined in depth, ranging from traditional print and television news, campaign advertising, candidate debates, and polling. The course will deal with new media and elections, and will examine the election online, citizen journalists and elections, and digital innovations, such as social networking, online video, and podcasts. We will conclude by speculating about the future of election media.\t\n\nStudents taking the course will have the opportunity to develop a research paper on a related topic of their choice.

To become thought leaders with our colleagues, we need to change our position from being merely consumers or\nusers of &ldquo;black-boxed&rdquo; technologies to becoming participants in important real-world decision-making about using existing technologies or developing new applications. For decades, when companies and organizations had IT systems decisions to make, it was always just &ldquo;let the techies figure it out.&rdquo; We now know this is no longer a viable approach for any organization. You will learn why we all have a major ownership stake in design principles, how they are implemented in tech products, why computing devices, platforms, and services seem &ldquo;blackboxed&rdquo; and closed from understanding, and how you can use design knowledge to participate at higher levels in any career path you pursue.\n\nWhat&rsquo;s missing in almost all disciplines devoted to operational and instrumental\ndevelopment of technologies is the unifying cross-disciplinary knowledge of design principles; that is, keeping in view the underlying universal design principles that enable any computer system (small or large) or software application to work as designed systems that are combinable with other systems.

Computing systems continually become more complex. Naively exploiting the abstract interfaces between technical specialties, sticking with the familiar and accepting the rest on faith, we neither grasp systems as wholes nor understand and create the new. Here, we instead demystify how and why programs make real things happen by sampling a wide spectrum of technology in a bottom-up progression from simple electronics to a representative computer system. That system, rather than being real-world, provides a coherent framework for understanding its purpose and mechanisms, uncluttered by historical artifacts and obscure optimizations.\n\nWe explore a simple NOT switching breadboard circuit, extend its design to basic logic gates, and go on to briefly discuss 2-d CMOS circuit design, fabrication, and market forces. Looking briefly at historical computing machinery from antiquity onwards, we adopt some concepts, including selections from Boolean logic, digitial arithmetic, information encoding, Finite State Machines (FSM), Turing Machines, and universal simulation. Using a few base digital design elements (MUX, DEMUX, and flipflop), we recursively describe higher-level organizational elements, such as, register files, memories, data-functional units, buses, input/output devices and interfaces, and controller FSM&rsquo;s. Instruction sets, execution phases, data and instruction flow, Harvard and von Neumann architectures, clocks, timing, and interaction protocol ideas are developed in the process of debugging our simplified, 16-bit, single-threaded, pipelined processor which includes split L1 caches, memory-mapped input/output devices, priority interrupts, privileged execution, memory protection, and address translation. We write small programs, both as text versions of pure binaries as well as using a one-pass assembler, and trace their circuit activity during execution.

This course examines narratives of historical and contemporary disability activism and advocacy in and around the nation&#39;s capital, as well as differences in strategy and action.

Organizations such as the Autism Network International, Autistic Self Advocacy Network, and Autistic Women &amp; Nonbinary Network infused ideals from the disability rights movement and early disability studies scholarship into social justice and civil rights focused activism. The neurodiversity movement remains contested space, with definitions of neurodivergence often disputed or misunderstood, and its issues ranging from abuse in residential treatment to autonomy for trans disabled youth, police brutality against neurodivergent people of color, and access to augmentative and alternative communication.\n\nThis course uses a mixture of primary source material and recent academic texts to trace the origins and development of the neurodiversity movement from its birth in the autistic community to its connections today to the mad pride, broader self-advocacy, and disability rights movements. Readings include early work by activists and cultural workers including Tito Rajarshi Mukhopadhyay, Naoki Higashida, and Bev Harp; and literature and contemporary works by scholars and artists by Anand Prahlad, Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, and Remi Yergeau situating neurodivergence, madness, and disability as sociocultural phenomena with profound political implications and possibilities for transforming ableist values and making new worlds."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "45993", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "10814", "description": "\r\n    This course first develops simple graphical and mathematical models of decision-making by individual economic agents: consumers, workers, and businesses.
