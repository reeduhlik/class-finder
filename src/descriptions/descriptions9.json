The course addresses fundamental research questions such as the following: Why do some individuals engage in behaviors that place them at increased risk for cancer (e.g., tobacco use, excess UV exposure, consume a poor diet, are physically inactive)? What determines whether someone is motivated to change their behavior to improve their health (e.g., knowledge and attitudes)? In what ways do biology, stress, and the environment contribute to cancer onset, and how do they influence cancer outcomes? We will also consider a broad range of ecological determinants of health-promoting and health-compromising behaviors, such as the family and community, health care providers and systems, norms and culture, and social media. We will examine how these interact to inform our understanding of behavioral cancer risk, prevention, and intervention efforts and the eradication of health disparities.

How are the racial inequities revealed by COVID-19 and the deeper reckoning with systemic racism sparked by George Floyd&rsquo;s killing changing our national narrative? We will analyze and reflect upon America&rsquo;s &ldquo;original sin&rdquo; of racism and how it still lingers in both attitudes and institutions, as well as on the fundamental demographic changes underway in the country and what it will mean to build a bridge to America&rsquo;s multi-racial future.

How does religion impact public policy, in positive and/or negative ways, and how do we examine and evaluate the difference? Historical examples&mdash;like the churches&rsquo; vital role in the civil rights movement&mdash;will all be discussed.

We will focus the discussion on how to design public policies to address these challenges. Finally, the course will focus on the main microstructural challenges and policies. We will start with a broad discussion on the evolution of the participation of the public sector in different economic activities and the effects of privatization processes, the effects of different trade policies implemented in the region and the design of appropriate mitigation and adaption policies to climate change.

Across the country, students in high-poverty schools and students of color are less likely to have access to experienced teachers, sufficient resources, advanced courses, and technology compared to their peers in more affluent schools.\n\nWhile the study of how to close gaps, or &ldquo;what works&rdquo; for educational equity represents an important contribution to the field, the question of how discriminatory policies create gaps in the first place, deserves more significant attention. The course will cover drivers of educational inequality that are rooted in contemporary educational policies and attempt to answer the question of how and why our school systems continue to manufacture gaps between different groups of students. Topics will include segregation, resource distribution, access to good teachers, school choice and others.\n\nIn addition, using the topic of educational inequality, we will discuss innovative research approaches and methodologies that are useful for uncovering policies of inequality in general.

The course will combine lectures and group discussions to help students navigate the complexity of U.S. infrastructure policy, especially around its economic development and climate dimensions. It will do so by (1) introducing the actors, institutions, and policy frameworks involved in overseeing different infrastructure systems; (2) examining planning and investment needs in specific infrastructure sectors; and (3) analyzing current and emerging issues around new federal funding, workforce demands, and technological changes.

However the war ends (and the end is not yet in sight), it will leave a Russia that is poorer, more backward, and isolated than it was on the eve of the Russian invasion. The damage to Russia will come from three main sources: the long-term impact of international sanctions, the return of the climate-change agenda, and the likely political upheavals as the Putin era comes to an end. For Putin&rsquo;s eventual successors, a great reckoning lies ahead. The Long-Term Impact of International Sanctions: The tidal wave of sanctions that has hit Russia since the onset of the invasion will take a long time to unwind. Russia has been cut off from the international flow of finance; its exports of commodities will be less profitable; and the revenues of the Russian government will be lastingly reduced. The impact of sanctions varies from sector to sector, but overall they will cause a steady drag on Russia&rsquo;s capacity to invest, to innovate, and to provide for its citizens. China beckons, but it is not a solution. The Return of Climate Change to the International Agenda: Of all the countries that stand to be affected by climate change, Russia is at the top of the list. Russia is one of the most dependent on the export of hydrocarbons. One-third of its territory lies north of the Arctic Circle, and its Arctic coastline stretches for 24,000 kilometers, much of it consisting of permafrost. Its forests, vulnerable to disease, drought, and fire, are the world&rsquo;s largest, and account for over half of Russian territory and one-fifth of the world&rsquo;s forested area. And as the world&rsquo;s fourth-largest emitter of CO2 and many harmful pollutants, Russia is both one of the chief causes and victims of global warming. The Coming Political Succession: By the early 2030&rsquo;s -- if not sooner -- Vladimir Putin will likely leave the political stage, closing a reign that by that time will have lasted longer than Stalin&rsquo;s. The succession is unlikely to be smooth. Putin created a regime in which most of the institutional foundations of government have been systematically weakened; civil society has been reduced to impotence, and no viable mechanism remains for making democratic choices. The result is likely to be a chaotic contest among competing clans, chief among which will be the various security services, which are perennially at war with each other. The Russian population is likely to be confined once again to a spectator role, punctuated only by occasional outbursts of protest that will fail to generate meaningful change. What, then, will be the future of Russia, if the coming era brings economic stagnation, climate-induced stress, and political instability? Or is this bleak future inevitable?
