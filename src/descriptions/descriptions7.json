Students will learn about the central concepts of human factors engineering and system safety engineering, which have the goal of creating safer, more efficient healthcare systems. Students will learn how factors such as training, devices, IT systems, policy, work culture, and environment impact safety culture, as well as the quality and timeliness of care, and how they can apply these concepts to their everyday practice of medicine and in their future leadership roles. The elective will be offered to a maximum of 15 fourth year medical students. Each group will meet for two hours per session, three sessions per week over a four week period. Initially, one elective per semester will be offered. The course director will facilitate two-part sessions. The first part of each session, lasting one hour, will consist of lectures from experts in the field of human factors engineering, risk management, patient safety, and system safety engineering, from within and outside of Georgetown University and MedStar Health. These lectures will be structured around actual illustrative case studies of accidents and incidents from the healthcare safety literature and will include case studies from other complex industries such as aviation. Students will learn the principles of human factors engineering and system safety engineering, and ways to apply these concepts within their own work domains. The second hour of each session will alternate between student-led discussion on a paper or article related to the session topics and group activities such as hands-on workshops. These activities and group discussion sessions facilitated by the course director will focus on current topics in the safety field, such as actual medical device evaluations, adverse event reviews, and other participatory learning exercises. Students will be required to read coordinating papers, articles, and book sections for each lecture topic, and be prepared to discuss these topics. One time during the course, each student will be asked to present an article either from the lay or academic press related to the topic of the session. Students will also visit a hospital or outpatient unit as part of a field experience to conduct a hazard analysis and identify potential safety issues, and will be required to write a short paper on their findings. As a final project, students will be divided into small groups to conduct a redesign of hospital unit, such as an emergency department, inpatient unit, surgical suite, or ICU, using the principles, methods, and techniques for improvement developed during the course. In the final course session, students will present their redesign to the class and lead a discussion about the pros and cons of their design from a safety standpoint. Students will be assessed for completeness of the concepts that they employed in this design as drawn from the lecture component of the course.

The course will illustrate how the patients you have been caring for in your clinical rotations in the hospital and in the community are affected by the larger health care system. Our faculty lecturers, as well as invited outside experts who work in health policy and public health organizations, will speak to the students about important health system issues and how to incorporate public health and public policy knowledge into their future careers. We will take advantage of our training location in the nation&#39;s capital and have the students visit various health policy and public health agencies and institutions. The course is a four-week elective for medical students. The first two weeks will be didactic sessions in the mornings and site visits in the afternoons. Residents from Medicine, Family Medicine, Pediatrics and Emergency Medicine will also attend lectures and site visits during the first two weeks. During the second two weeks, students will be set up at a health policy organization in DC for a mini-internship to work on a small physician advocacy or public health project. The course will be designed for learners who have an interest in health policy/public health issues, but have no advanced degree (MPH/JD) in health policy or public health.

It is estimated that one in three childbirths is perceived as traumatic, with\nadverse outcomes on mothers&rsquo; mental and physical health (Gamble et al., 2005; Soet et\nal., 2003; Deforges et al., 2020; COST Action 18211). As usual, society informs literature\nand vice-versa literature has the potential to bring awareness and change in society and\nmedical practice. In fact, in the last few years, birth narratives have emerged as a new\nliterary genre, and pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum have been investigated from\nvarious perspectives and in different languages around the globe. The aim of these stories\nis multifaced and varied but they all share common goals: breaking uncomfortable taboos\nand tell personal experiences that had previously been silenced. In the wake of #metoo\nand other social movements denouncing obstetrical and sexual violence, birthing people\nhave started to tell their experiences to denounce abuse, misinformation, and lack of\ninformed consent. The act of writing helps to process and overcome trauma, inform other\npeople, and provide evidence-based information, or &ndash; in the event of positive experiences\n&ndash; inspire readers through empowering birth stories.\n\nThis one-credit course will address a corpus of contemporary transnational texts\npublished in the last few years by focusing on birth trauma, pregnancy loss, and\nempowerment through childbirth. By close reading and textual analyses, we will shed new\nlight on how pregnancy, birth, and postpartum shape contemporary literature and\ninvestigate how these experiences are conveyed in writing.\n\nThis course uses the interdisciplinary methods of medical humanities and explores the\nintersection of medicine, literature, and the social sciences. We will use contemporary\nsources such as articles, testimonies, and cross-genre texts to investigate how pregnancy,\nbirth, and postpartum are perceived in contemporary society. We will identify key factors\nfor achieving positive and empowering experiences, and pinpoint how trauma could be\navoided. We will also determine how birth narratives could bring change in obstetrical\ncare and improve communication between patients and health care providers.\nSecondary sources introduce students to the fields of narrative medicine (Charon 2001;\n2006) and trauma studies (Herman, 1997; Nadal and Calvo, 2014), while selected primary\nbibliography reveals how birth is experienced in contemporary society.

Change is often resisted, but may also be embraced. From the health of our bodies to the borders of our nation-states, change defines the arc of human existence.

In doing, we will consider the ways in which scientific and medical developments both inform and are informed by arts and culture. What was psychological thought used for? Who did it benefit? Who did it injure? How can we see these intersections between science/medicine and culture today? Some psychologists include: Alexander Bain, Wilhelm Wundt, Edward Titchener, and William James.

We have inherited sophisticated immune systems developed over multi-million years to meet changing threats to health. Their present form is contingent on many evolutionary acquisitions in the progression from ancient innate recognition systems to the flexible learning associated with adaptive immunity. The basic processes that govern change - mutation, selection, and chance - are explored in detail, and the role and limitations of each in human health are discussed. The evolution of immune systems is studied using comparative approaches, from prokaryotes to modern humans via lampreys, jawed vertebrates, primates, apes, and our close relatives, the Neandertals and Denisovans. Potential selection drivers are investigated, and evidence of selective pressures is identified. The shortcomings of our immune systems are discussed, and the biotechnological approaches now being used to overcome known limitations are explored."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "30581", "description": "\r\n    This seminar will contain a variety of research-based lectures in the field of Microbiology &amp; Immunology.
