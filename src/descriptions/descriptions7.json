Humor in medicine finds its place in discussions about our understanding of different types of people and personalities, end-of-life issues, coping with illness, and as a means to mitigate burnout. From Shakespeare to Scrubs and Dr. Patch Adams, the pleasant physical audible reaction (laughter) and its corresponding internal state (emotional joy and happiness) will be explored.  The course will be divided into four parts. First, the course will expose students to the current understanding of what laughter is and how it varies from person to person. Humor will be tied to health in terms of research, therapeutics, healing power, and the use of humor in provider-patient encounters. Second, the students will learn: how medical humor and the practice of medicine have appeared in classic literature, movies, television, the arts, and the Internet and how these portrayals may impact the knowledge,  attitudes, behaviors, and the perception of medicine in society. Third, the course will review how humor has both benefits and inherent risks&mdash;humor can be used to address stressful situations, a provider&rsquo;s own stress, and to improve workplace culture but humor can have unintended negative ramifications.

Medical students are exposed to many of these concepts during 3rd year clerkships. This course will provide the student with an in-depth exposure to how a palliative medicine team can make an impact on quality of life for patients and their families. The specialty focuses on physical symptoms such as pain management, including opioid and non-opioid regimens, non-pain symptoms such as nausea, dyspnea, agitation, delirium, anxiety, depression, intractable hiccoughs, and others. Through assessment of and attention to the complex emotional, spiritual, existential and ethical distress of patients and their families, students will gain a unique &lsquo;cura personalis&rsquo; perspective of patients with advanced illness. Advanced communication skills are employed to ensure that patients receive appropriate and patient-centered care in a complex medical environment.\n\nDuring the 4-week rotation, the medical student will participate in the inpatient consultation service, providing initial consultation and subsequent follow-up. The student will also participate in the evaluation and management of patients in the ambulatory palliative medicine clinic.

Origins of innate and of adaptive immunity. Generation of diversity for T-cell and B-cell receptors and for major histocompatibility (HLA) systems.  The genetic and the molecular basis of disease associations with HLA.   Understanding why HLA is the most critical locus for so many complex diseases.  Genetics of natural killer cell receptors.   Phases in cancer: elimination, equilibrium and escape.  Cancer genome project: driver and passenger mutations. Immunotherapy in cancer. The microbiome in immunity and cancer.  \r\n\r\nThe students will be guided to understanding the origins and functions of the systems that protect the body from invasion. The course will explore the unique genetic systems that generate the wide diversity of antigen receptors which learn how to recognize molecular features distinguishing our proteins and metabolites from those of invading parasites, microbes and viruses.  The genetics of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is explored, as well as that of the T-cell and B-cell receptors.  Genome wide association studies (GWAS) indicate the strongest associations with diverse diseases ranging from the infectious (e.g. leprosy, viral control of HIV and HBV) to the complex and autoimmune (e.g. \r\nnarcolepsy, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, psoriasis, irritable bowel disease) occur in the HLA region.  The molecular and evolutionary reasons that make the HLA an epicenter of disease are explained and individual disease associations studied in addition to the role of HLA polymorphisms in transplant histocompatibility.  Connections between cancer and immunity are explored.  The elimination of aberrant cells can be compromised by the occurrence of lesions sheltered from the immune system in cancer.  Equilibrium occurs in which altered-self remains un-eliminated while chronic inflammation generates a tumor microenvironment that promotes growth and ultimately migration of cancerous cells. The students explore the technologies (next generation and single cell sequencing) that have enabled the simultaneous profiling of genetic and metabolic markers in multiple cancers.  The roles of the microbiome in responses to therapy are examined. Immunotherapy (Science breakthrough of 2013) is explored. The targeting of checkpoint inhibitors is shown to promote the renewal of immune function against the tumor cells and their elimination from the body."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "29039", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "26256", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "12240", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "12241", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "24453", "description": "\r\n    This course introduces the student to basic military leadership the organizations, missions, customs, and traditions of the U.S. Army and the Department of Defense.

The future of the 2024 American presidential election could be shaped by President Biden&rsquo;s response to this conflict. Internationally, a chasm has emerged between the West and the global south over this issue as reflected in UN General Assembly and Security Council votes and the January 2024 International Court of Justice ruling on the question of genocide in Gaza.

Before evaluating the conclusions, the class generates a list of questions and &ldquo;Learning Objectives&rdquo; which they fulfill by researching previous literature prior to the second week. The second session begins with a discussion of the information relevant to the Learning Objectives and the questions raised during the first week are answered before critically evaluating the conclusions of the paper.

How does the brain do it? For instance, how can signals from one hundred million photoreceptors on the retina fit through an optic nerve with just one million fibers? Given that many cognitive tasks are too varied to be coded genetically, how are tasks learned in the &ldquo;deep&rdquo; processing hierarchy of the brain, with some 13-odd synapses in the decision pathway? How does the brain learn to associate actions and rewards? How can we make decisions in the face of uncertainty? How does the brain deal with the redundancy of the motor plant, coordinating many joints to reach points in three-dimensional space? How can the brain recall complete memories from partial cues?  This class will examine these and related questions, showing how cognitive processing across a variety of areas can be grounded in a small number of key neurocomputational principles. Emphasis will be placed on showing how these principles apply to a variety of cognitive domains, including vision, audition, memory, motor control, and decision making. The goal of this introductory class is to convey the underlying computational ideas with a minimum of mathematical overhead, stressing their usefulness even for areas of cognition where data are still insufficient to constrain quantitative models.\n\nCourse Description\nCredits: 2\nTime: Tuesdays, 1:15pm &ndash; 4pm\nDates: Class starts on 9/1/2020, until 12/1/2020\n\nLocation: Neuroscience Meeting Room, Research Building, WP-07\nCourse Director: Maximilian Riesenhuber, PhD, Professor of Neuroscience (mr287@georgetown.edu)\nOffice: New Research Building, WP-12\n\nOpen to graduate and advanced undergraduate students from neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, computer science, and related disciplines.  Undergraduate students should contact the course director for permission.\n\nPrerequisites\nBasic knowledge of neuroscience and/or psychology. Basic calculus and linear algebra. Willingness to learn whatever background is lacking. Contact the course director if unsure.\n\nCourse Structure and Requirements\nThis is a 2-credit course, but classes meet for three hours each, which allows for off-weeks when we won&#39;t meet, see the schedule below and the course schedule on the Canvas site. I highly recommend you add the Canvas online calendar to your personal calendar.  Each class will consist of a lecture by Dr. Riesenhuber on the topic du jour and student-led presentations and discussions of research papers (4 papers of 20-30 minutes of presentation &amp; discussion each), see &ldquo;Schedule and Papers&rdquo; below (note that the &ldquo;Optional background papers&rdquo; are optional further readings for those interested in particular topics). These presentations should include critical analyses of the methods and results, along with a discussion of the implications of the findings and three questions to be discussed with the class. Presenters should feel free to discuss questions about their papers with the course director in advance of their presentation.  All class members will be expected to have read these papers before class and to come prepared with relevant questions/comments/ideas for the discussion. In addition, there will be (optional) computer exercises on key topics in the form of Jupyter notebooks that students can work on outside of class.\n\nA final project will be due on December 1. The final project will take the form of a 15-minute presentation on an original computational neuroscience project of the student&rsquo;s choosing. The project should aim to test (either experimentally or through simulations or a combination thereof) a computational hypothesis about the neural bases of a particular cognitive function. The presentation (to be emailed to Dr. Riesenhuber at mr287@georgetown.edu by midnight on December 1 &ndash; each day late takes off 5% of final project score) needs to include specific aims of the research project, background information about the topic studied, and a description of a series of experiments/computational studies to address the Specific Aims. The presentation must include a discussion of what conclusions could be drawn depending on various outcomes of the experiments. An outline of the project (1 page of Specific Aims, due November 17, but earlier submission is encouraged if students already have a project idea) must be approved by Dr. Riesenhuber so that students can receive feedback on the appropriateness of their chosen topic before working on the presentation.\n\nParticipants&rsquo; grades will depend on 4 paper presentations (40%), participation in class discussions (20%), and the final project (40%)."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "29038", "description": "\r\n    Laboratory rotation."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "26258", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "12365", "description": "\r\n    Thesis research leading to a doctoral dissertation."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "12366", "description": "\r\n    Thesis research leading to a doctoral dissertation."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "44820", "description": "\r\n    The gross anatomy course introduces the students to the anatomy of the human body by presenting the fundamental concept of the body as an interrelated set of organ systems.
