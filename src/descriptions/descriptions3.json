Moreover, narcotics-related violence in Honduras, Mexico, Jamaica, Colombia, and Brazil has been a pervasive threat to the well-being of those populations. In some cases, drug trafficking groups have captured parts of the state and, in more extreme examples, have ascended to the highest political office in the country, as is the case for Honduras. This insecurity has spawned major development challenges, such as mass migration, poverty, institutional decay, underinvestment, and lower life expectancy. In national surveys where homicides are high, violence/security is often cited as the top concern for people migrating out of the country. In Central America, violence costs the GDP on average between 11 and 18 percent, diverting limited resources to security and away from job creation, healthcare, social security, and other social priorities. Yet despite these devastating impacts, criminal violence has traditionally been combated especially by national governments by &lsquo;mano dura&rsquo;. That is by imprisoning those that are suspected of being perpetrators which often means young poor men. Governments have used the police and also military to suppress violence often through mass imprisonment however this approach has not resulted in dramatic reductions in violence over the long term.\n\nThis course is project-based but will provide a broad historical overview of the political, economic, and social forces that have allowed gangs and criminal organizations to become integrated into many parts of Latin American and Caribbean societies. The course will use selected countries to provide greater detail as to how these forces have shaped the current trajectories of each country and the varied responses. The course will focus on additional countries that have had innovative responses to addressing gang violence in their country, including gang-mitigation and reinsertion projects as well as adapting traditional development projects in the context of criminal violence. Through project-based work, students will develop a proposal to address the root causes of gang and criminal violence in a Latin American or Caribbean country. The projects developed will draw upon real-world examples from the World Bank and other international institutions. Students will present their proposals to World Bank officials who work in security and development in Latin America and the Caribbean for practical feedback."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "44611", "description": "\r\n    Building Cross-Sector Partnerships for Social Innovation and Impact Cross-sector partnerships have the power to solve big problems and drive transformational change. Governments, companies, civil society, philanthropists, and innovators are increasingly exploring and testing new ways to work together to address global development needs. The scale, complexity, and interconnectedness of our world&rsquo;s greatest challenges require a collaborative, cross-sector response to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. While there is no single blueprint to design and operationalize a successful cross-sector partnership, there is an art and science to building partnerships that work. This course will equip students with a foundational understanding of proven and novel cross-sector partnership models designed to solve global development challenges, examine real world cases of partnerships addressing local-to-global social and environmental issues and provide a roadmap to conceptualize, build and operationalize cross-sector partnerships for social impact."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "44258", "description": "\r\n     How do we address social and economic exclusion and leave no one behind?

For most people, and especially in poor countries, jobs are their main source of income. People work their way out of poverty through better and more productive jobs. However, the nature of jobs varies hugely across countries. In high-income economies, jobs will typically have a contractual nature and be associated with a steady pay. In poor countries, jobs are more likely to be associated with self-employment and be more volatile in terms of earnings. The process of development changes the nature of jobs and the conditions of work. At the same time, the types of jobs and employment an economy generates can have spillover effects on the development process itself. Some jobs have a bigger development impact than others. \n\nIn this course, we will think about jobs, workers and labor markets in the context of economic development. We will examine the following questions: How do jobs change with the development process? Are some jobs better for development? What are the barriers that get in the way of the creation of jobs and the matching of jobs and workers? What is the role of government in addressing those barriers? Do labor markets match workers and jobs in a fair way? What types of inequalities arise in the labor market? What should governments do about them? What kinds of policies can help marginalized groups, youth and women? We will also look at how trade and capital flows, technology and migration transform labor markets, and will discuss how government policies may help address the challenges brought about by these trends.\n\nThis is a seven-week course. Each week will focus on a core topic and cover the analytical framework; relevant empirical evidence and country examples; and policy solutions and interventions. Classes will be highly interactive and require substantial preparation on the part of students. Topics will include:\n\n1)\tJobs, poverty and development\n2)\tUnemployment, underemployment and informality\n3)\tWomen and work\n4)\tThe challenge of youth employment\n5)\tGlobalization, technology and jobs\n6)\tCross-border migration and refugees\n7)\tRethinking policies through the jobs lens\n\nPre-requisite:\nThe focus of the course is on policies. However, a good understanding of core economic concepts is necessary.

Ensuring that this spending enhances the health and education of the poor is critical, but difficult. This course introduces students to the economics of the social sectors with an emphasis on low-income countries. The education part of the course starts with an overview of historical trends in enrollment and learning worldwide. It then takes students through key concepts in measurement, description and causal analysis, with a focus on a systems approach to education. This part of the course will cover key concepts such as development accounting, item response theory, value-added measurement modelling, the industrial organization of the private sector and government failures in education. The health part of the course focuses on the delivery of health care in low-income countries and will cover the economics of preventative healthcare, the quality of care, private sector care and healthcare insurance.

However, many dependent variables in applied empirical research are not continuous. Some are binary, such as answers to &ldquo;yes/no&rdquo; questions in surveys, others are discrete &ndash; i.e. they take on a limited number of integer values &ndash; and distinctly bounded, such as a (non-negative) number of terrorist attacks, and even unordered, such as items a household purchases from a basket of goods. Sometimes, the dependent variable equals zero for many observations, such as the number of farm animals owned by urban dwellers. In these circumstances, the linear model is usually not well-suited.

Experiments involve a scientist randomly manipulating a &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; in a carefully controlled environment in order to isolate its causal effect on dependent variables of interest. Experiments in social sciences and program evaluation have become increasingly common. At the same time, many social phenomena we care about cannot be experimentally manipulated for practical, ethical, and/or financial reasons. As an alternative, researchers have been developing a number of quasi-experimental techniques that attempt to approximate the true experiments.

While there are still no conditions in Syria to start the implementation of this resolution, the international community needs to prepare a plan of action in anticipation of a political breakthrough.  Holding elections is a key part of the planned peace process.  Building on similar electoral processes conducted under international supervision (Cambodia, Bosnia/Herzegovina, Kosovo, and East Timor), the students are asked to design a plan for the preparation and conduct of credible elections in Syria under UN supervision, in accordance with international standards.  This will include developing legislation, timelines, electoral system scenarios, voter registration, mostly likely scenarios for Election Day, as well as hypothetical post-election recommendations.  The research will also include a framework for the parameters of &ldquo;international supervision&rdquo; in this context, the establishment of a provisional electoral management body (EMB), and the impact of transitional justice on the political environment.  And, given that nearly five million &ldquo;registered: Syrian refugees reside abroad (the estimated actual number is more than six million), and there are 6.6 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), special attention should be given that those segments of the electorate are included along with an out-of-country (OCV) voting plan.\r\n\r\nThe Study Group will produce a narrative document according to these terms of reference and present their findings in a briefing at USAID offices in Washington D.C.

How does moral and religious pluralism and diversity affect the inclusion of moral claims into law and policy?

When law and policy clash with moral and religious culture, which gives way to the other, and are there moral or legal principles for determining how to navigate and/or solve this conflict? \r\n\r\nIn the first part of the seminar, we will examine the representative theories of this relationship through close readings and discussion of works to include: classic and modern accounts of positivism and command theory in law, (including some attention to modern political theories about the purpose and limits upon political states); classic and contemporary views of natural law \r\nand its claims about the civil order; the debate between H.L.A. Hart and Lon Fuller over whether law has an intrinsic moral content; Catholic social teaching and Protestant political thought regarding the moral demands upon the political order; the debate between Hart and Lord Devlin over whether the law and political order may be utilized to sanction behavior on exclusively moral bases; American political thought about the Constitution and limits upon state power over individual (moral and religious) actions; and contemporary political theories about the demands of justice imposed upon political states in a global era. \r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the seminar, we will investigate three clusters of legal cases and political conflicts in which morality and religion appear as central components of the conflict: 1) the de-criminalization of certain modes of human sexuality and the recent debates over same sex marriage; 2) the clash over the contraception provisions of the Affordable Care Act and demands for religious accommodation; and 3) the relevance of moral and religious claims for legal debates over the efficacy/legitimacy of the death penalty. \r\n\r\nA research paper will be the main requirement for the course, along with careful preparation for and participation in the seminar."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43798", "description": "\r\n    This course will consider the role of religion and nationalism across traditions and political cultures."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43780", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43781", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43782", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43784", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43802", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "46553", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "46063", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "45971", "description": "\r\n    This course examines the political dimensions of the foreign aid process and its implementation."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "45972", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "45973", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "45974", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "45975", "description": "\r\n    This course examines topics related to political economy considered from both an international relations and comparative politics perspective."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "46554", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "45976", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43787", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43791", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43284", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43285", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43286", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "13375", "description": "\r\n    This course is designed for students who have taken GREE-011 or who have some rudimentary Greek language skills.

We will explore major political, economic, social, religious and environmental changes on the continent, but we will also think about how historical knowledge is created and how historians assess evidence about the past.The first goal of this course is for you to acquire historical background to contemporary Africa.  By looking at general patterns as well as specific places and events, we&rsquo;ll examine some of the major themes in Africa&rsquo;s recent history.  We&rsquo;ll study Africa&#39;s role in the 19th-century global economy and the political and social impacts of this early globalization; European conquest of the continent and African resistance to European domination; the political and economic impact of colonialism; major cultural, social and religious changes of the early 20th century; and how independence from colonialism was achieved and what it meant.  Then we&rsquo;ll turn to the era of independent African nations and explore the historical context of some of the issues facing present-day Africa.  We also will examine dynamics of age, gender, class, and ethnicity within African societies. And throughout the class, we will consider how Africans have acted to create their own history within the context of larger global and historical forces they do not control.A second goal of the class is for you to begin to think about the origins of knowledge: to ask how we know what we think we know.  What do terms such as &ldquo;African&rdquo; and &ldquo;European&rdquo; mean in practice, and what do they obscure? How has &ldquo;the West&rdquo; created knowledge about &ldquo;Africa,&rdquo; and what are the implications of this?A third goal is to think and write like historians. We will ask questions and explore puzzles about the past. With Africa serving as the context, you will practice the art of historical analysis.  Questions we will ask throughout this class include: Why did something happen when it happened and what were its consequences? How have unequal relations of power shaped the kinds of historical evidence we have today, and how can we interpret that evidence?

Lionized by some, vilified by others, the Jesuits have been involved in virtually every facet of early modern and modern culture in all corners of the globe for half of a millennium. This seminar is about the what, why, and how of Jesuit thought and action, and the strong reactions they inspired.\nTheology has been central to them, but they have also engaged in philosophy, the arts, and the sciences from their 16th-century founding by Ignatius Loyola to the present day, as a Jesuit reigns as pope. Jesuits, individually and corporately, have grappled with politics and political thought from Reformation de-bates over regicide to modern debates over social justice. Jesu-its can be found on all sides of the Galileo Affair, and Jesuits run the Vatican observatory today. Jesuits were among the first Europeans to enter the Forbidden Palace in the 17th century and were expelled from Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s Iraq in the 20th. Jesuits developed havens for indigenous people in 17th century New Spain and simultaneously engaged in the transatlantic slave trade. Jesuits produced anti-semitic tracts in 1920s Vienna, but participated in the plot to overthrow Hitler in the 1940s. In the last century they ran elite high schools in Mexico, but were executed for advocating radical social and economic reform in Central America.\nTheologians, polemicists, political theorists, astronomers, dramatists, pharmacists, architects, engineers, governors of Amerindian settlements, cartographers, musicians, and, above all, missionaries and schoolmasters, Jesuits were active in virtu-ally every country of Europe and Latin America, in many countries of Asia, and even in a few in Africa.

We will primarily consider and examine works of painting, sculpture, and architecture, but we will also give some attention to urban planning, practices of collecting, the decorative arts, public rituals and festivals, music, theater, dance, garden design, and other forms of creative expression (including in a few cases literary texts).\n\nWe will start by examining the historical, intellectual, moral, and theoretical bases for the connection between art and power, and by connecting these ideas and practices with the revival of the study of antiquity. We will then consider several case studies of how these connections were deployed in specific places and times. Many of our materials and case studies will come from Italy, where some of the main elements and language for these ideas were formed in the Renaissance, but we will also look at how these practices spread and were adapted in other parts of Europe and in later centuries. Because the dominant form of political power in Europe in these centuries was monarchical, most of our materials will pertain to the activities and pursuits of monarchs, aristocrats, and Church leaders, though we will also consider, especially at the start and end of the class, examples from different political systems.\n\nWe will consider evidence both textual (descriptions, theories, biographical sources, etc.), and visual, and we will read the works of modern scholars about these issues and examples.

Space agencies in the United States, China, and Russia have all committed themselves to establishments settlements on or near the Moon, and are building enormous rockets to make that possible. A growing number of space agencies have now dispatched satellites or rovers to the worlds near Earth: the Moon, Mars, Venus, and nearby asteroids. These machines have revealed cosmic environments to be more dynamic places &ndash; with more dynamic histories &ndash; than scientists previously imagined. Companies led by ambitious tycoons are introducing revolutionary technologies that will allow them to reach, and perhaps even colonize, the Moon, Mars, and possibly Venus.\n\nThis course will guide you through the long and often surprising history that has led us to this new era. You will discover, among other topics, how what happens in space has helped shape life on Earth; how early astronomers mapped and often misinterpreted environments on the Moon, Mars, and Venus; and how sudden environmental changes on Earth and on Mars provoked sightings of canals &ndash; and fears of alien invasion &ndash; across the western world. You will learn about the twin &ldquo;space races&rdquo; that led humans to the Moon and robots further afield; the plans to establish military bases on the Moon; the Martian dust storm that inspired the idea of nuclear winter on Earth; the shocking greenhouse effect on Venus that strengthened theories of global warming on Earth; and the history of a radical ambition to turn Mars into a world like Earth.

However, it conveys an important point about the transfer of cultural knowledge in the early modern world. The foodways that Old World people brought to the New remained embedded in ideas and practices that were already established African and European cultures centuries before 1492. When New World crops such as maize, chilies, tomatoes, beans, and sweet potatoes arrived in the Old World they created some new options for cooks, but they were used in traditional ways. Transformative change came only when African and European foodways came into direct contact with each other and with the culinary traditions of Native Americans. In time, distinctive approaches to cooking, eating, and drinking emerged from these interactions which involved the exchange of agricultural methods, technologies, and tools as well as cooking equipment, culinary techniques, and, of course, recipes. In this class we will investigate this complex development of American cuisine through the study of material culture and also of ideas and social practices that influenced what, how, and with whom Americans cooked and ate. The focus will be on Anglophone North America from the early seventeenth century to the middle of the nineteenth century, when new technologies for processing, preserving, and cooking food disrupted older patterns.

Gentrification can be considered a process by which urban space is reorganized along an uneven socioeconomic and racial axis to privilege and serve the needs of the most advantageous class. Understanding this process requires the firm grasp of two important fields: (1). 20th century urban and suburban history and (2). American cultural and intellectual history. Gentrification or what some might call &ldquo;back to the city&rdquo; movements, has a long history since the founding of the earliest American cities. However, during the second half of the twentieth century, this term came into prominence when in the absence of industrial mass production and in the aftermath of deindustrialization, cities and neighborhoods underwent a re-branding as consumable experiences ripe with &ldquo;authenticity.&rdquo; The former central city districts that long sheltered communities of color and poor migrants after World War II became sites of failed federal policies during the 1950s and 1960s that further produced more, rather than less, segregation. The fiscal crisis of the 1970s generated new urban policies that effectively curtailed services to the inner city and created subsidies for gentrification and redevelopment in hopes of altering shifts in population that would bring to the city a new class of urban consumers. In this class, students will explore the long history of American gentrification, the political economy that shaped it, the voices and memories of those displaced, and the romance of authenticity that supplanted poverty.

Although we are accustomed to thinking about immunology with respect to pathogens and disease, the function of the immune system in fighting microbes is really a manifestation of its fundamental role as a system whereby the body knows itself. Throughout our lives, the immune system gathers and interprets information about the body. When something is not right, whether it is due to a microbial pathogen, or traumatic tissue damage, or cells growing abnormally to become a tumor, or the presence of transplanted foreign tissue, our immune system is activated to try to restore homeostasis. When it malfunctions it contributes to disease. In this course, we will learn the basic principles governing the functioning of the human immune system. The first few lectures will refer to the immune response to microbial infections. Defense against infection was the first function of the immune system to be recognized and is the best understood. Infection makes a story that has a beginning, middle, and end, and you should be able to tell that story about half way through the course.

In doing so we will spend much of our time navigating the process of monitoring and evaluating Place-making, an SFS pilot that encourages students to explore and make their &ldquo;places&rdquo; in the world. Place-making aims to do so by offering a collection of self-designed projects, classes, programs, and local and global community building opportunities. Students in IDST-326/INAF-330 will support this innovative project by shaping the prototype goals, designing relevant metrics for evaluation, making design choices for the programming, and working with a team of content experts to track learning objectives that will inform future designs. Mapping out what &ldquo;success&rdquo; looks like for the pilot, and exploring what the future iterations of Place-Making might be, will enable students in IDST-326/INAF-330 to test elements of broad and diverse designs against empirical feedback from a real-world educational prototype.
