Since the 2005 Paris Declaration, effective development policy and practice has been a key feature of the international cooperation agenda. Moreover, the concept has been embraced by successive USAID administrations, NGOs, humanitarian non-profits, consulting firms, industry associations, and academics alike. Few concepts seem less controversial than shifting power to and sharing it with local actors who take charge of setting the agenda, making decisions, and designing, managing and implementing programs. At the same time, dynamics within low and middle-income countries are independently driving localization. More so now than ever, aid recipient countries and local actors have access to finance and expertise to increasingly direct their own resource allocation and decision making.\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn light of these trends and in recent years &ndash; especially in the wake of the COVID pandemic, the global DEI movement, and a collective reconciliation of international development&rsquo;s colonial past &ndash; there has been a renewed push toward better defining what exactly is meant by and required to achieve locally led development. The question goes beyond the capacity of local actors, although that is certainly an important consideration. In this new paradigm, fundamental questions are arising about the nature and role of international donors themselves, how they view and manage risk, if their procedures and requirements are fit for purpose, and whether they are the ones with capacity gaps that must be filled. And what are the implications for international Implementing Partners (IPs) &ndash; i.e., NGOs, consulting firms, humanitarian focused non-profits, university centers and the like &ndash; and must they start redefining their role and adapting their operating models?\n&lt;br&gt;\nThis 7-week module course will explore the complex dynamics at work both within the international community, as well as within aid recipient countries themselves, surrounding locally led development, localization, or local ownership (all terms heretofore used interchangeably).

Students will challenge assumptions and examine successes, failures and track record of locally led development policy and practice. Class discussion will center on real-world reading material from international development policymakers and practitioners &ndash; i.e., policy statements, analytic and diagnostic reports, case studies, toolkits, operational documents, program evaluations and other grey literature.

Second, working on select country case studies, we will discuss how practitioners apprehend the complex factors that influence resilience to shocks and stresses in a given context, a process critical to developing and improving a theory for effecting change. Third, we will discuss how forced displacement has become an urgent development challenge for hosting countries facing significant challenges in meeting their own development goals while accommodating people displaced for long periods of time. Fourth, and because over the past decade, more people have been killed from political violence and homicides in middle-income countries than low-income ones, we will discuss the extent of the issue drawing on several case studies.

Throughout the eighteenth century, European thinkers, writers, and artists increasingly thought of themselves as &ldquo;modern,&rdquo; and at the same time also confronted cultural differences shaped by nation, class, race, religion, gender, and other factors.

Perlstein alluded to the fact that the established story of modern conservatism &ndash; what most historians and the broader public thought they knew and understood about the Right &ndash; could hardly have led to our present and Trump&rsquo;s rise. Historians have begun to rethink the history of the Right. And at the center of that re-conceptualization stands the relationship between mainstream conservatism and the Far Right.
