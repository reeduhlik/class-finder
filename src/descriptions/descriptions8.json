This class reveals new and hidden ways to improve your SQL skills, solve problems, and make the most of SQL as part of your workflow. There are variant relational and non-relational databases. In this class, we will cover MySQL (relational database) and MongoDB (non-relational database).\nThe dynamic nature of MongoDB lends itself quite naturally to working with a dynamic language such as Python. The tradeoffs between a dynamically typed language such as Python and a statically typed language such as Java in many respects mirror the tradeoffs between the flexible, document-oriented model of MongoDB and the up-front and statically typed schema definition of SQL databases. Python allows you to express MongoDB documents and queries natively, through the use of existing language features like nested dictionaries and lists.

Through examining time series we can identify trends and patterns that enable us to make forecasts and to ascribe to those forecasts an adequate measure of the uncertainty surrounding the forecasts.\n\nThe course will focus primarily on quantitative methods for forecasting, ranging from purely extrapolative approaches to causal modeling, but with some coverage of judgmental methods. After a review of basic tools for developing and evaluating forecasts, non-seasonal and seasonal time series models will be discussed with a focus on Exponential Smoothing and Holt-Winters&#39; class of models, as well as the ARMA and ARIMA class of models.\n\nThis course will provide students hands-on experience with analyzing real data using statistical software tools (Excel and R Studio).

Aristotle also held that we are social creatures and that we can&#39;t flourish without friendship. How do we keep in our lives good friends that are also good?

Not just historical, but also contemporary examples abound showing health to be fundamentally contextual and contested, whether along lines of cultural differences, religious differences, or even differences pertaining to the practice of science itself. Because healthcare is central to2 much of modern life, the difficulty to define and understand health is not just a theoretical oddity, but a practical problem. A core premise of this course is that one cannot inquire into the meaning of health without also inquiring into the meaning of normality and disability.

The microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical ensembles will be considered and some other ensembles will be noted.  Both classical and quantum systems will be investigated.  Most applications will focus on systems of non-interacting particles, although some of the techniques for dealing with classical interacting systems will be noted and one or two selected interacting quantum systems will be briefly considered.  The first applications will be to a system of localized spins, vacancies in a solid, and a rubber band.  Then, Maxwell-Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Bose-Einstein statistics will be discussed and applied to the classical gas, electrons in a metal, blackbody radiation (photons), lattice vibrations (phonons), the ideal Bose-Einstein gas, and the Ising model.  If time allows, second quantization will be introduced and applied to one or two of these systems.  The last portion of the course will be principally concerned with phase transitions, specifically first order phase transitions, phase separation, continuous phase transitions, and the Landau theory of phase transitions.

The course explores the ethical responsibilities all intelligence professionals have toward themselves, corporations, the government, and the public. Students contrast the roles and responsibilities of intelligence professionals among other law enforcement, homeland security, and competitive business professionals. In the third part of the course, students apply an appropriate decision-making framework and gain experience in decision-making surrounding ethical issues.

Looking at ethics through a professional lens, students are asked to explore their own values and are challenged to codify and commit to their own code of ethics in relation to a broad range of professional codes of conduct and best practices. Foundational concepts in ethics are woven throughout the program&rsquo;s other courses and revisited throughout a student&rsquo;s tenure in the program."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "38558", "description": "\r\n    Design, as both a concept and a practice, has the ability to affect change within business and throughout society.
