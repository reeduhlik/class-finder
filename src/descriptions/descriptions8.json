It is an integrative science that applies the principles of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, chemistry, neuroscience, and genetics to understand drug actions. The principles of pharmacology are illustrated in the two subdivisions of the discipline: pharmacodynamics, the study of mechanisms by which drugs produce their biological effects (i.e., how drugs affect the body), and pharmacokinetics, the study of factors that determine the concentration of the drug at its site of action (i.e., how the body acts on drugs). Since pharmacology is often considered to be a bridge between the basic sciences and clinical applications of drugs, in addition to basic principles of pharmacology, this course will endeavor to provide a foundation for understanding how drugs are used in the management of diseases and disorders, as well as the basis for their adverse effects.     \r\n\r\nThe use of specific drugs may change during the course of your education, and they will certainly change over the course of your professional career; however, the fundamental principles of drug use and the targets and mechanisms of drug actions remain relatively consistent.

This course helps you as a potential leadership team to understand and prepare for the impact of these technologies.\nWe also use two leader tools in analytics: Brandwatch for Customer Analytics using SQL queries, Python to build an Interactive Data Analytics Dashboard.\nThe objective of this course is to provide an easy-to-understand, state-of-the-art overview of the key technologies underpinning this fourth industrial revolution and outline how they are practically used by businesses today, as well as provide some tips on how to best prepare yourself and your organization for the transformation they bring."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "14409", "description": "\r\n    This course will introduce students to decision support systems and their role in business.&nbsp; Specifically, the course will present a systematic way to think about decisions and formalize decision modeling in order to arrive at more informed choices and better outcomes.&nbsp;The emphasis of the course is on teaching students how to effectively model decisions along with teaching the practical skills needed for building decision support systems.

But they can also pose novel and significant risks to our societies. For instance, artificial intelligence systems trained using machine learning techniques and enormous data sets are being deployed for a rapidly increasing number of important tasks. These range from the mundane, such as recommending movies and targeting advertising, to the crucial, as in hiring or even pre-trial detention decisions. These AI systems raise pressing new ethical issues. For instance, many of these systems display discriminatory bias. How can this bias be mitigated? Who should be accountable for ensuring that it is? Moreover, the effectiveness of machine learning depends on collecting huge amounts of information about people, i.e., &ldquo;big data.&rdquo; Who should be allowed to collect such data, and what data should be collected? What rights do individuals have to privacy and anonymity? The complexity of these technologies also poses novel problems of governance and accountability. What kinds of explanations are people owed for how an opaque AI system treats them? How can we hold developers and deployers of opaque systems accountable for their behavior?

An intersectional approach will give us the opportunity of understanding the link between the destruction of the environment, sexism, racism, classicism and colonialism. We will discover the ways in which feminists help us conceive of less predatory epistemologies of nature, re-think Western ontology centered on the human being, imagine new ethical relationships with any form of life, and explore spiritualities profoundly connected to the world around us. Ecofeminist literature will allow us to approach some important theoretical debates both in environmental and feminist studies while rereading major definitions and theories of nature in Western philosophy from Renaissance to contemporary philosophers. It will also lead us to debate very concretely the ways in which we can challenge our daily lives to start taking action. Among the questions that we will ask: What is the relationship between environmental crises and the oppressions of women across the world? How has patriarchal culture alienated us from our bodies and our link to other natural beings? Is ecofeminism relevant in order to address issues such as climate change?

We also briefly describe Fermi&#39;s golden rule, the sudden approximation, and the creation of light from atomic hydrogen. Next we will describe the interaction of atoms with lasers and magnetic fields including trapping atoms and the Jaynes-Cummings model.
