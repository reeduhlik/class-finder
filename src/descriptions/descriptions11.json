This course enables students to more effectively conceive and architect solutions that meet customer needs or respond to market opportunities while reducing validation and verification risk. This is a highly interactive graduate level course that leverages engaged lectures and a group project that students pursue in small teams (3 to 5 students per team, as a function of class size). This course provides students with a disciplined approach for formulating a customer or stakeholder need/opportunity and translating this understanding into a solution or response concept through a highly iterative process of prototyping and concept development. Ultimately, the students will translate this solution approach into a set of specifications for a system or service that meets the need/opportunity. The focus initially is on developing an outside-in view that treats the system as a black box, without regard to the components from which it will be built. The course emphasizes the distinction between an operational need/opportunity and a system solution, and stresses the importance of understanding the customer/stakeholder need before converging to a solution. The course helps students understand how to think through the choices at each step of the process. What decisions have to be made? What factors should be considered in making them? It is the answers to these questions that make for good systems thinking when formulating a response strategy to an operational shortfall or opportunity, not just adherence to a standard process.

Students will be asked to examine their own values and convictions and will develop skills and tools to put them into practice through embodied performative interventions into the social world. By focusing our attention on students&rsquo; own life experiences and the issues in our own local/ campus, regional, national, and global communities (local/ campus, national, and global) that each student cares about most deeply, students will draw connections between the intimate personal register of their own creative selves, and their active participation in the communities they occupy. Case studies and performance activities will focus not only on the content but also on the form and the context of diverse creative processes. Class exercises and assignments will emphasize experiential learning as we both participate in guided improvisational workshops and develop skills in creating and facilitating our own original performance workshops, and ultimately a final ensemble creation as a class.

Theatre production professionals combine the knowledge of materials and techniques with the skills to communicate meaning through line, shape, pattern, light, and sound. In this moment of performance of all types moving online, Technical Production considerations have essential impact on the success of a digital show.\n\nUsing core texts on stagecraft and drawing on experiences of seasoned professionals, students will learn the methods that transform designers&rsquo; ideas into tangible objects on stage and online.

In a county that sees liberty as its purpose, this statement would suggest that religious liberty is something all Americans agree upon. However, increasingly, religious liberty has become a contested ideal that often seems to divide Americans. This course traces the backstory to religious liberty in America, the controversies that have surrounded it, and the ways in which it has been not only &ldquo;our first liberty&rdquo; but also the lens through which the nation has understood and demarcated church-state relations. The course also places emphasis on the specifically religious roots of religious liberty and the ways in which religious communities have become the greatest defenders of religious liberty across the globe today. Key US Supreme Court cases on religious liberty are considered as well as the ways in which religious liberty is conceived and evaluated in other cultural contexts. Do all peoples understand/desire religious liberty as it is understood in the US? Finally, the course invites students to grapple with the relation of religious liberty to the common good.

MBSR practitioners tout the benefits of becoming conscious of their own thoughts, feelings, and sensations and observe these states in a nonjudgmental way.\nModern medicine has rediscovered the power of MBSR to heal both the body and mind. This has raised interesting questions about the mechanisms of action of MBSR (how and why it works), and wonderment about its utility (where it can be applied)? The course explores what is known about the neurobiological effects of MBSR on the brain, especially areas related to attention and memory, sensory processing, and stress and emotions, and downstream effects on physical functions.
