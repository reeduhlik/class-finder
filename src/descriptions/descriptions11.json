The reading of classical texts like the Upani\u1e63ads, Satipa\u1e6dh\u0101nasutta, etc., will be followed by the phenomenal experiences and noetic accounts of popular, contemporary mystics.

Stace&rsquo;s essentialist model and Steven F. Katz&rsquo;s contextualist model. The analyses of these experiences will be accompanied by leading cognitive neuroscientific, clinical psychological, and evolutionary approaches. In addition to the psychedelic era during the 1950&rsquo;s-1960&rsquo;s in the United States, we will also study cutting edge research on meditation and psychedelic interventions that use psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, mescaline, etc., performed by labs like Johns Hopkins and others."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "45236", "description": "\r\n    Myths and mythological language undergird some of the deepest questions that biblical authors seek to answer: Who are we?

The work recounts an imaginative vision of a journey though the afterlife which Dante himself narrates. It is not only one of the world&rsquo;s greatest works of literature, but also an important representation of the theological outlook of the Middle Ages as understood in the Western Church of the 14th century. Dante grapples with the great existential questions of the meaning of human life, the morality of human actions and their consequences, the existence of God, the problem of evil and suffering, the theology of grace, predestination, salvation, and merit. The many characters that emerge along the way are often real historic persons whose life stories form the basis of Dante&rsquo;s weaving of the text. He does not shy away from the political controversies of his day, and offers some insight into how Christian theology formed a cultural matrix for Western civilization.
