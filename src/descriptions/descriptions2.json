What can close attention to the crafting of objects reveal about cultural values, social structures, battle tactics, belief systems, aesthetic sensibilities, daily pleasures? Investigating such questions will take us to DC area museums, including the Smithsonian Museums, the National Gallery of Art, the Textile Museum, and Dumbarton Oaks. Conversations with curators at these museums will enrich our understanding of the interdisciplinary methods scholars use to gain a deeper appreciation of human creativity during this period and to reconstruct the past from the textual and material fragments that remain.

Analyzing foundational criticism and theory about motherhood alongside a variety of predominantly U.S. cultural texts&mdash;from I Love Lucy, Imitation of Life, and varieties of poetry to Roseanne, and Toni Morrison&rsquo;s Beloved, and the recent documentary Google Baby&mdash;we explore how differing notions of motherhood are constructed, contested, negotiated.

Through learning those mechanics, students should gain an understanding of the ways a corporate enterprise can be valued.\n\nThe primary goal of this course is to provide you with a good grasp of the basic drivers of value creation through exercises in Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation and to gain understanding of how these drivers manifest themselves in Multiples based valuation. Through these exercises, you should gain a solid understanding of the ways in which the value of an enterprise can be estimated. The second major goal of this course is to develop tools which will help you conduct and communicate your analyses.  Specifically, this course will require frequent use of spreadsheet modeling. This method involves examining an actual company, for which you are expected to use your knowledge (from class lectures, assigned readings, etc.) to estimate the value of the enterprise. This method is designed to help you relate the subject knowledge to a practical situation.&quot;"}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "36133", "description": "\r\n    &quot;This course focuses on core principles of how to value a business enterprise.

It is a required course for German majors and strongly recommended for students who are planning to study abroad or are otherwise interested in using German in a professional environment (e.g., the business world, banking, non-governmental agencies, think tanks). Themes addressed in the course include some of the following topics: the role of German past in the German society today, the higher education scene in the German-speaking countries, the role of Germany in the European Union, environmental protection, issues of migration and identity, political movements, etc. \r\n\r\nStudents will be guided to attain a level of accuracy, fluency, and complexity in German that should enable them to interact competently and comfortably in private as well as some public settings where they begin to address a range of issues in contemporary German public life. Accordingly, the course places particular emphasis on language use in public settings, referring to various socio-cultural and political issues or addressing how historical events and interpretations shape contemporary sensibilities and policies. Its particular focus is on language use in academic settings, so that students can perform the kinds of tasks that define academic work, in listening, reading, writing, and speaking.

In each case we will examine the relationship between meaning/content and linguistic forms, from the organization of whole texts all the way down to specific choices in vocabulary and grammar.

Furthermore, the Tatort has been credited with reflecting social and cultural changes in German society over the past five decades. This close tie between a fictional police series and social history is in part the result of the public broadcasting system (and its many regional stations) that produces the Tatort and that has to pay close attention to a mainstream television audience. Unlike other police series, the Tatort is shot in many locations throughout Germany and even Austria and Switzerland, each featuring a group of local detectives.\n\nThe course investigates this unique lens on German society by focusing on the following aspects:\n\u25cf Introduction to the history and regional concept of the Tatort, with special emphasis on the successful relaunch of the series in the early 2000s.\n\u25cf Popularity of the series across generations; fan culture; synergy effect of websites and social media.\n\u25cf Changing genre conventions and introduction of new types of detectives: blue collar (Schimanksi), women (Odenthal and others), ethnic minorities (Batic and others).\n\u25cf Changing crime scenes, ranging from interpersonal and familial conflicts to global crime networks and terrorism.\n\nFollowing introductory readings on the genre of crime fiction in general and the Tatort in particular, students will view selected Tatort episodes as part of their homework assignments, starting with some of the early ones of the 1970s. (Students are encouraged to watch the Tatort in groups of 2-3 and to read plot summaries, available on Wikipedia or &ldquo;das erste&rdquo;, prior to viewing a new Tatort episode). In the second part of the semester, students will work in pairs and introduce a new Tatort to the class.\n\nAdvanced language acquisition is fully integrated into the subject matter of the course. Supporting materials for genre-specific conventions and terminology (e.g., film analysis, film reviews, etc.) will be provided and practiced. Throughout the semester, we will pay attention to language use (e.g., by looking closely at some Tatort scripts and by identifying formal and informal responses on Tatort websites) and to visual and narrative genre conventions of police series (e.g., alternatives to the traditional &ldquo;whodunit&rdquo; approach). Finally, we will examine specific investigative approaches and their ethical and legal implications. For instance, in contrast to the focus on scientific investigation methods in popular US police series like CSI the Tatort series often examines the motives and social conditions of the perpetrator.\n\nOverall, students will acquire the visual, linguistic, and cultural vocabulary to critically discuss the Tatort series and its role in German society.\n\nCourse structure\n\nTeil I: Einf&uuml;hrung zum Tatort: die Anf&auml;nge in den 70er Jahren\n[Taxi nach Leipzig, 1970] &ndash; Reifepr&uuml;fung, 1977\n\nTeil II: Neue Ermittlertypen &amp; soziale/gesellschaftspolitische Themen: 1980er-1990er Jahre\n[Die Neue, 1989] &ndash; Engelchen flieg, 1998 &ndash; [Duisburg/Ruhrpott, 1991]\n\nTeil III: &bdquo;Neue&ldquo; Verbrechen -- Tatorte im Zeitalter der Globalisierung, 2000 bis heute\nBlutdiamanten, 2006 &ndash; Sonnenseite, 2006 &ndash; Willkommen in Hamburg, 2013\n\nTeil IV: Psychologie der T&auml;ter &ndash; Psychologie der Ermittler\nVom Himmel hoch, 2018 &ndash; Herz aus Eis, 2009 &ndash; Sturm, 2017\n\nPlease note: only a few of the episodes are available with German subtitles; for a couple of other episodes I have access to the script and we will spend some time reading and analyzing sections thereof.

The response of literature and visual arts to such experiences was not a mimetic one anymore. Rather, the task of art was to make this new and changing world accessible and understandable by creating literary and visual forms that were able to grasp the new experiences caused by increased industrialization, urbanization and new technologies: new forms of poetry (Trakl, Benn), a new form of the novel (Rilke, Kafka, D&ouml;blin), or new forms in filmmaking (Ruttmann, Lang, Pabst).\n\nThis graduate course focuses on literature and films in German modernism of the early 20th century.

As the birthplace of the Westphalian state system and the European Union, it is home to the most traditional and radical concepts in international affairs. Europe has now entered a new era marked by the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet and Russian empires, and the reunification of Germany. This course focuses on continuity and change in European international relations: on how European states have structured their relations with each other and the world through time.\n\nThe course begins with an overview of the kinds of questions that are of interest to those who theorize about international relations: What motivates state action? How have evolving notions of sovereignty and nationhood changed international interactions? Subsequently, the course presents several historical case studies including traditional European alliance systems and the Cold War in order to apply the theoretical discussion. Finally, we examine the characteristics of the European order that has emerged over the past two decades: the tensions between integration and fragmentation and the role of regional integration in contemporary international relations debates including international trade, market regulation, and security. At the completion of the course you should be an informed consumer of international relations theory, have a grounded understanding of social science methodology and be prepared to connect these theories and methods to current events transpiring in Europe today.."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "18099", "description": "\r\n    GEST 980 is the capstone course of the MAGES Program.

While Russia is the most well-known, sophisticated, and prolific hostile measures actor in Europe, it is far from the only one. An array of foreign governments seek to influence policy and\npublics in Europe to achieve their foreign policy aims via overt and covert means. China&rsquo;s campaigns have become more visible recently, whether its &ldquo;Wolf Warrior&rdquo; diplomacy or its campaigns to win influence using economic tools like the Belt and Road Initiative or PPE donations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other actors such as Turkey and the Gulf states mount campaigns with more limited aims in places like the Western Balkans. This course will explore the actors who mount hostile measures campaigns in Europe, assess their aims, and evaluate their success &ndash; or failure. We will identify the tools and tactics they employ and analyze how these campaigns manifest in case studies drawn from across Europe.

Against the\ncurrent backdrop of wars, famine, climate change, pandemics, and other crises, effective systems\nof global governance &ndash; which require cooperation and compromise &ndash; have never been more\nimportant. Great power rivalry affects global governance acutely. The Biden Administration\nhas committed to &ldquo;relentless diplomacy&rdquo; in the multilateral space. China is asserting its interests\nabroad with increasing vigor. Russia is embroiled in a UN Charter-busting war with its\nneighbor. And the European Union is striving to become a geopolitical force.

How do medium-sized and smaller countries fit into the multilateral puzzle? Are current\nsystems of global governance fit for purpose? What could a successful system of global\ngovernance look like? The course focuses on the United Nations, which at 77 remains the main\nmultilateral arena where the action of global governance plays out. Through case studies, with\nparticular emphasis on the UN Security Council, it looks in detail at the way the United States,\nChina, Russia, and Europe interact and pursue their interests in the fields of security,\ndevelopment, climate, and human rights policy.

This will include the economic analysis of public projects; empirical approaches for assessing the progressivity of taxes and expenditures; tools for assessing the efficiency of public expenditures; etc. The course expects to develop the following skills and knowledge: knowledge of key concepts in public finance; knowledge of analytical tools and techniques; and technical and practical skills in the analysis of government operations."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "42834", "description": "\r\n    People say you are what you eat. Can what we eat change the world? Today&rsquo;s food system is not fit for purpose - it produces more than enough food, yet there are more people living in hunger than ever before, it is a leading source of GHG emissions, biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, unhealthy diets, and a large share of people that run it live in poverty. This course explores the public policies and investments necessary to bend the arc of the food system to deliver healthy people, a healthy economy, and a healthy planet. Students will learn to apply economic and financial cost benefit analysis techniques to public policies and investment in the food system. Each student will undertake a case study tailored to their specific area of interest of the food system (food security, nutrition, agriculture, biodiversity, climate change, etc."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "31786", "description": "\r\n    Social protection (SP) is the field of study that examines policies and programs to prepare societies and individuals to manage socio-economic risks. SP aims to protect people from a range of shocks, including those caused by economic crises, pandemics, chronic poverty and climate change. SP also seeks to provide people with opportunities to build a better life for themselves and their families. This course will provide students with an overview of the major concepts and policy instruments in the area of SP, covering social insurance, social assistance, safety nets and labor. This includes cash transfers (conditional and unconditional), in-kind transfers (seeds, fertilizer, school feeding, etc.), fee waivers and scholarships, public works, old age pensions, and programs for specific vulnerable populations. Second, the course will examine social protection systems and delivery mechanisms, including targeting, payments, monitoring and evaluation. Country case studies will be used to illustrate how these concepts and instruments are applied in practice by policymakers.\n\nThis course has two main learning objectives. First, to equip students with the key theoretical, analytical and practical skills and frameworks used in the field of social protection. Second, to enable students to approach the assessment, design, implementation, and evaluation of SP programs and schemes both at the country and specific program level in a systematic, evidence-based manner. The course is organized as an interactive seminar, with a premium on student participation."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "36905", "description": "\r\n    Increasingly, development innovation and social service and product delivery are being initiated by the private sector, in particular with a focus on projects that are sustainable, scalable and with a positive social or environmental impact. The private sector, both domestic and international, now holds the largest slice of the global development contribution pie.  What roles does the private sector play, and how might their impact be maximized?  The role of the for-profit sector in social value creation will be examined, with particular attention to impact investing, impact bonds/pay for performance schemes, intrapreneurship, corporate social responsibility initiatives, and public-private partnerships."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "42758", "description": "\r\n    Small and medium enterprises or &ldquo;SMEs&rdquo; represent a large share of developing countries&rsquo; private sectors. The support and promotion of their development is, therefore, an intuitive reaction of international development actors. Yet, many challenges arise when establishing the target, type, and level of intervention. Targets can be unclear due to country-specific definitions, often lacking statistics and data due to the heterogeneity and informal character of SMEs. Interventions can be financial or technical and their focus can vary widely, from poverty reduction to economic growth. They can address SME-internal, sector-specific or countrywide issues. Furthermore, the most appropriate actor to lead the intervention may be the national government, the subnational administration, business associations, NGOs, international donors and organizations, or the private sector. \n\nRecently, a new dynamic that integrates business-management approaches related to organization, process, or service models into human-development efforts has gained momentum. Many of these new ideas are tested and promoted by small enterprises. Thus, the course will look at private sector and SME development as an objective, the private sector as an actor for development, and business management as a toolbox for innovative development ideas."}]
