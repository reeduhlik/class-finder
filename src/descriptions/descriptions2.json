Specifically, we will look at dialogues between the American dream and madness, between &ldquo;normal&rdquo; communities and maniacal individuals, between &ldquo;The City on the Hill&rdquo; and the &ldquo;wilderness&rdquo; beneath. Then, as we move into the late 19th Century and 20th Century, we will focus on specific contexts of Gothic fiction&mdash;namely, the female Gothic, African-American Gothic, Southern Gothic, urban Gothic&mdash;and we will consider what these novels and short stories reveal about alternative narratives (especially narratives of otherness) that confront the dominant story of a &ldquo;self-evident&rdquo; culture. Among many questions we will address: What is the relationship between the distinctly interior notion of America as an idea (a dream) and the psychological nightmares expressed in many of these texts? What are the distinct forms of dominant culture paranoia that issue from nature spaces and urban spaces? Why might the American South be a repository for the Gothic and the grotesque?

He credits his engagement with GU students as further inspiration to some of the choices he&rsquo;s made in revising his design to get the narrative &ldquo;right&rdquo; as well as engage with DC politics!

You will select which archival artifact you would like to work with to create your paper for the course. You will engage in primary research which is very exciting and also, pragmatically speaking, provides a boon for that cv! Thirdly, the last several years have prompted many historians; literary, visual and performance artists/art and history curators; technology experts; and film makers to re-visit the endless causes, details, and effects of this war. Might you be interested in experiencing what the final moments of the war sounded like? Join us and this experience is yours.\n\nThe somberly sonorous voice of Yeats in his 1920 &ldquo;The Second Coming&rdquo; perhaps most wondrously confronts both the horror of WWI, the brute itself, and the ensuing madness unleashed upon a new century perceiving its ideals lost but not gone: &ldquo;Turning and turning in the widening gyre. . . Things fall apart. . . The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere [t]he ceremony of innocence is drowned. . . And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, [s]louches toward Bethelehem to be born?&rdquo; Modernism&rsquo;s vision ghosts the war&rsquo;s bitter but resilient afterbirth, offering us a battlefield strewn with individual suffering and resurrection beside the mass shame and redemption. And we, the 2019 readers in English 168.1, enter the surreal fray begun in 1914 of chivalric courage that becomes the sacrificial charge to rescue friend and the barbaric attack to defeat foe. This course invites its participants to read a medley of perspectives and genres of WWI literature in order to ask how and why this war both reflected and catapulted change in the ways we understand and value life, provoking such questions as where is our present or immediate identity, both individual and collective, in light of this war&rsquo;s influence? How did this particular war cause chivalry to give way to the monstrous? What happens to perception when the beautifully strong becomes the grotesque freak? Did we land in the abyss of the Great War&rsquo;s aftermath because we leapt from Edwardian extravagance or Victorian hubris or even complacency? How might we justify an idealistic regard (nostalgia) for the past, given our shattered memory? How do we sustain a hope that both trembles before and yearns toward a future in the wake of futility? Why did this world experience (the Great War and its effects), which destroyed the lives of so many, also propel liberation for women? To what degree did it also shift economic class identities? How and to what effect did its technological advances &ndash; even with humanitarian aims - participate in moral degradation? Why did so many artists respond NOT with anger or grief but instead with cynical detachment &ndash; did they reflect the sympathies of the masses or were they a movement unto themselves? And given the unique (Heroic? Showy? Game-Changing?) role of the U.S. in this war, how has our own nation&rsquo;s history in global fighting been shaped by this war? How do we, living in the U.S. as both citizens and scholars, remember this war? How does the Great War&rsquo;s Art of its own time and of our time provoke us to re-view this war and our role within it as well as on its borders? Isn&rsquo;t it intriguing to consider that the language of the performing arts, such as theatre (a space of entertaining audiences and perspectives), resounds in identifying battlegrounds, often referenced as theatres of war, and the medical operating room, often marked as the surgical theatre. Further, how were entertainment halls &ndash; theatres &ndash; sites of recruiting soldiers as were propagandist posters appealing to women&rsquo;s power, the value of family, and an individual&rsquo;s right and responsibility to enact moral duty?\n\nParticipants in this course are encouraged and expected to ponder such questions and to create other queries from the readings for each class.

It is a prerequisite for Intermediate and Advanced Script Writing, the middle and final stages.\n\nThe course starts from the Aristotelian precept that plot is character in action. But it also insists on the primacy for film of the image and of montage. From the beginning students are encouraged to see how the camera invariable lies, and how the frame functions at the same time to display and to conceal, to reveal and to mislead. To illustrate this complexity, during the term the course reviews a broad selection of the major films of Alfred Hitchcock, the master of classic American film syntax. Those films are supplemented by a smaller number of others from the Studio Sound Era, 1935&ndash;1985. The films are screened for the class on Sunday afternoons; all screenings are mandatory.\n\nInterested students are advised to approach ENGL-284 primarily as a writing course, and only secondarily as a film course. They can expect to write regularly, at least once and sometimes twice a week, responding to specific, craft-oriented prompts that cover incrementally an increasingly complex menu of script techniques and topics."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "45504", "description": "\r\n    I met a lot of people in Europe&rdquo; novelist James Baldwin reported. &ldquo;I even encountered\nmyself.&rdquo; Foreign travel, even as it opens new vistas for us and splinters old stereotypes, offers us a transforming mirror.

Almost all of these ventures are single founder/employee type of ventures where the founder has neither the desire nor the possibility of creating a significant business organization. A small fraction of such ventures however hold the promise to grow into large businesses. In this course we will focus heavily on such promising ventures. The reason for this focus is self-evident - business that are unlikely to grow fast have little or limited need for external financing-making such ventures irrelevant for a course titled Entrepreneurial Finance &amp; Venture Capital. This course is designed to illustrate challenges faced by an entrepreneur in financing and growing a new firm. Exploiting a promising opportunity frequently requires an entrepreneur to marshal scarce resources, especially external capital. The course will focus almost exclusively on issues relevant to the financing of entrepreneurial ventures. We shall devote significant amount of time on understanding the role of Venture Capital (and to a lesser degree on Angel Investors) in financing new start-ups. The course requires and reinforces the skills needed to analyze a business with a strong emphasis on financing deal terms and valuation techniques. The course concludes by examining the harvesting of entrepreneurial ventures whereby the entrepreneur and the financiers realize the returns for their effort. The course is driven almost exclusively by case studies, many of which are based on start-ups or young firms."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "45805", "description": "\r\n    This course explores the process of founding and funding of new healthcare ventures.

First, the sequence prepares students for upper-division French courses and for direct matriculation overseas study programs by focusing on the development of critical thinking and advanced writing abilities. Second, it enhances students&rsquo; capacities to perform close reading and analysis by introducing them to a variety of texts and documents selected to increase their content knowledge of the culture, geography, history, literature, and artistic media of the French-speaking world. Individual sections of these courses will emphasize specific approaches to French and Francophone cultures and literatures, such as the anthropological, the historical, the thematic, the formal (including notions of genre) and/or the rhetorical, depending on instructor expertise. Study and analysis will be carried out in class discussion, as well as through specific writing formats (such as explication de texte, dissertation, research paper) for which students will receive structured training, including systematic procedures for organization, drafting, and rewriting, as well as an introduction to research materials and methodology in the discipline. The final paper for each course will be designed to mobilize the reading, analytical and research competencies developed over the course of the semester.

By selecting topics representative of a particular period, by including writers who pursued diverse intellectual and professional pursuits, and by providing multiple perspectives on a range of social, ethical, and artistic issues, the course aims to provide a richly textured understanding of a person and his or her time.

Schnitzler and Hofmannsthal, Wagner, Klimt, Freud, and Wittgenstein are some of the illustrious names that time evokes. What is often forgotten in nostalgic views of that Viennese culture is the fact that many of these creative minds produced many of their works not before, but after the First World War which devastated the Habsburg Empire much more than the German Reich. While practically no warfare had occurred on German soil, the Habsburg Empire was sliced apart and reduced to an economically gutted and politically miniaturized version of its previous self.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nIn this course, students will read texts of some of the great writers of the time against the backdrop of this devastation.

The notion of the public sphere articulated in Kant&rsquo;s Was ist Aufkl&auml;rung? helped to facilitate a new understanding of &Ouml;ffentlichkeit that was distinct from older models of representative public space associated with aristocracy and the court. As Reinhart Koselleck has argued in his groundbreaking Kritik und Krise, in the eighteenth century, seemingly &lsquo;private&rsquo; institutions such as the coffeehouse, the Masonic lodge, and the salon became the basis of bourgeois public life and the forerunners of middle-class public institutions. Meanwhile, in popular literary works of the era, ideals of domestic life and private virtue from England and France quickly gained currency and helped to define the self-image of the culturally and socially ambitious German B&uuml;rgertum. The Europe-wide cult of sensibility and the homegrown religious strains of Pietism also colluded to produce new ways of conceiving of the individual&rsquo;s place in the family and society. Through an examination of literary and philosophical texts together with historiography, works of critical theory, and cultural documents, this course seeks to frame and implement new ways of thinking about the public/private distinction and the relationship between cultural norms and individual experience in the eighteenth century and beyond. \r\n\r\nIn line with the goals of the MLA-sponsored &ldquo;Connected Academics/Reinvent the PhD&rdquo; project, the course readings and discussions of the public/private distinction will also serve as a critical framework for an extended reflection on the role of the humanities in the public sphere in America and Europe today.

The seminar addresses, first, the monetary policy institutional underpinnings and how EMEs formulate and execute monetary policy. It also analyses how different exchange rate regimes and the volatility of capital flows affect the conduct of monetary policy. The seminar then turns to financial sector issues, and discusses the importance of financial deepening for economic development, the fundamentals of financial stability and the roots and unfolding of financial crises, as well as the principles and operational aspects of macroprudential policy, considered the new international standard for preventing financial crises.\n\nThe seminar is designed for students in the M.A. in Latin American Studies, graduate students in relevant programs, International Business Diplomacy Certificate candidates, and junior and seniors in SFS with the relevant background. The seminar will be based on lectures, but will also demand participation from students, who will be required to present case studies.

A well-functioning health system decreases the burden of disease and improves i the health status and well-being of the population it serves. \r\n\r\nThe focus of the course is a comparative analysis of the performance of health care systems in a set of developed and developing countries with an emphasis on the latter. It does so by analyzing the main components of a health care system: its governance, its workforce, its financing, its organization, its information and surveillance capability, its use of technology, medical products and vaccines. Basic to this analysis is knowledge of how to measure the performance of a health system (equity, efficiency, quality and patients&rsquo; satisfaction) selecting valid, reliable and appropriate indicators. \r\n\r\nSocial determinants also affect health outcomes and must be taken into consideration in any comparative analysis of the health of a population. \r\n\r\nThe analytic approach of the course should expand your understanding of the functioning of health care systems by observing systemic differences rooted in history, culture, social, economic and political factors. It should also increase your knowledge of how and why health systems affect health outcomes. Models of organizing and delivering health care will be discussed and why and how these models have been adopted and adapted by each country. All countries pursue the goal of providing quality health care services efficiently and equitably to the whole population yet a comparative analysis will show that there are many paths to reaching &ndash; or only partially reaching - that goal. Countries continuously seek to improve their health systems by introducing or perfecting major reforms or by fine tuning existing health system components. \r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives: Students will be able to: \r\n\r\na.\tto use existing data bases containing health status and health system data to , compare and analyze the characteristics and performance of different health systems . \r\nb.\trecognize how history, cultural values and beliefs, and political decisions shape the development and functioning of health care systems. \r\nc.\tcompare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of different health systems (or its components) in selected counties. \r\nd.\tunderstand the different strategies that have been proposed and are being used to determine health priorities and allocate limited health resources . \r\ne.\tdevelop analytical, skills comparing health outcomes resulting from different ways of organizing, managing, financing and providing health care services."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "35182", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "42260", "description": "\r\n    This practical experience abroad exposes the Global Health Seniors to international health issues that other countries face.

In recent years, growing awareness has produced a large scholarly literature and broad support for gender mainstreaming in global health and development, e.g. in advocacy around the post-2015 development agenda. The premise is that the gendered organization of societies and economies has important implications for the health of people and in turn for the development prospects of nations. \r\nWhile much of the literature focuses on particular challenges faced by women and girls, the course will also ask important questions relating to the neglected distinction between sex as a biological category and gender as a social category. In this class we will think about &lsquo;gender&rsquo; as a metaphor for hierarchical relations between different groups, not just between men and women. \r\nAlthough women and girls are typically the most directly affected by gender discrimination, there are important disadvantages faced by men and boys as well. This is particularly relevant when one examines the intersections of gender with class, age, race, and ethnicity. In many parts of the world today, poor young men seem to be falling off the development ladder. Similarly, thinking about the health impact of the social and economic disadvantages of women, we will look at the myriad ways in which these inequalities translate into poor health outcomes for others (e.g. children) and slow down economic and social development in general. \r\nThe overall goal of the course is to probe the concepts underlying gender, global health and development, to analyze the postulated theoretical relationships, and assess how empirical evidence compares to these theoretical expectations.

The emergence of new strains, as it occurred with SARS CoV-1, SARs CoV-2, and the different recombination of influenza A with pandemic potential, are examples of these infectious hazards that threaten public health and have an interface with animals. It is important to understand the One Health concept that recognizes that humans, animals, and the environment are linked and that collaboration across multiple disciplines is fundamental. Students will have the opportunity to discuss several case studies with this vision and to present their analysis of selected global health emergencies from the One Health perspective."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "44845", "description": "\r\n    This course is designed for introductory biostatistical theory and application for students pursuing a master&#39;s degree in fields outside of the Department of Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Biomathematics.

On these pillars, students then can develop the platform for statistical inference including proportions and means, multiple regression, and ANOVA."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "36091", "description": "\r\n    This introductory graduate course presents the principles and methods of epidemiology, including descriptive and analytic approaches to assessing the distributions of health and disease in populations and factors that influence those distributions. The emphasis is on developing an understanding of concepts, rather than quantitative methods, although calculations are involved. The course also provides basic research skill training including literature review strategies; human subject protection strategies; research proposal writing; and report presentation.  Through the combination of lectures, readings, critical review of papers, case studies, and lab on research proposal writing, students without prior coursework in epidemiology will acquire the core competencies in epidemiology research expected of all Master level Global Health graduates."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "40510", "description": "\r\n    The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the definitions and practice of data management and analysis using statistical programs and the basics of survey design."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "27804", "description": "\r\n    The Health Economics and Finance course aims at equipping students with tools to assess health system performance, mostly in terms of cost effectiveness and equity. After a brief review of the main concepts used in both macro and micro economics, the course will focus on assessing the allocative and technical efficiency at all levels of the health system. This will entail analyzing the major issues facing health care systems that impact their performance. The course will stress the importance of financing scheme in the performance of a health system: the main risk pooling schemes will be presented in connection with their results in health status, patient satisfaction, efficiency, equity and capacity to contain costs. The course will explore strategies for public and private financing, providers payment and delivery options, and will conclude on a few best-practices, both in developed and developing countries."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "25334", "description": "\r\n    This 3-credit course aims to provide professionals and students with essential skills to formulate evidence-based health policy and to understand, analyze, and evaluate the structure, organization, management, and performance of health systems in low and middle-income countries. \r\nCourse objectives are to equip students with the knowledge and skills to analyze and evaluate the governing policies and performance of healthcare systems and health programs; to hone the ability to identify problems and suggest potential solutions; and to devise alternative evidence-based reform policies that would contribute to improve the health status of the population.
