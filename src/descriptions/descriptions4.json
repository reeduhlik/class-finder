The general objective is to develop students&rsquo; proficiency in oral and written Italian, to provide them with the tools not only to communicate in formal and informal encounters and exchanges in the target country, but also to function in Italian within academic environments.

Such topics range from the representation of value systems and cultural attitudes typical of the Italian people to reflections on the history and development of their language. The focus of the course is on the process of writing and on the strategies that can be used to improve it. Students are exposed not only to different topics, but also to different writing genres: from literary narrative texts, to academic texts, to argumentative or informative texts taken from Italian newspapers and periodicals. The work on the language will be related to the texts in the sense that grammar will not be taught separately, but in the context of the genre analyzed. Students will produce different types of texts: from descriptions, to letters, to film or book reviews, to argumentative texts, in order to build the skills necessary to write academic papers. The actual writing process will be carried out both in individual and group format and students will be encouraged to write different versions of the same composition in order to gain confidence and fluency.

As bankers, politicians, patrons, writers, cardinals, popes the Medici represent the perfect example of a civilization that used beauty and the arts to achieve power, and dynastic prestige.  \n\nThe Medici also had a strong influence on the Catholic church with popes and cardinals, such as Leo X, and Clemens VII.  Some members of the family were crowned monarchs of France (Caterina and Maria, queens of France), and others, through marriages, established a direct or indirect influence on many aristocratic and powerful European families of the time.  The Medici faced setbacks, and exile, but eventually they became the absolute rulers of the city of Dante and Machiavelli for more than two centuries.  The last Medici, Giangastone, was the twilight of the dynasty.  He died without heirs, and the blood line was extinguished.\n\nThe course will explore literary texts, paintings, plays, political and economic aspects related to such a prominent family. Also, it will explore diversity issues, such as the African origins of the first Duke of Florence, or homosexuality in Renaissance Italy and Florence.  The importance of patronage cannot be stressed enough, as well as the importance of political meanings and messages &ldquo;carved&rdquo; into some of the most beautiful, and influential masterpieces of all times.  Also, the strategies that the Medici adopted to achieve wealth and power are of particular interest even today.\n\nThe course will also explore thinkers such as Machiavelli, or great architects such as Brunelleschi, and Alberti, or artists, and the relation that the Medici had with the political and cultural milieu of Florence.

Songwriters such as Fabrizio De Andr&eacute;, Francesco De Gregori, Roberto Vecchioni, Francesco Guccini and others changed the key of Italian popular music: for the first time the authors of the songs were also their interpreters. The cantautori mixed sounds and rhythms from Anglosaxon rock and blues with Italian melody and bel canto, while at the same time making politics, love and societal changes the subjects of their lyrics. The cantautori have chronicled in a direct, unabashed way, the history and changes of modern-day Italy.\r\nThe social and political commitment of the cantautori becomes manifest through their employment of literary references and distancing from the clich&eacute;s of the Festival of Sanremo and mainstream music.

We will discuss international and domestic protests over politically sensitive cartoons, controversies over Holocaust denial, whether hate speech should be banned, whether the media can ever be legitimately constrained on national security grounds, whether anti-gay religious activists have a right to disrupt military funerals, whether pornography and violent lyrics deserve protection, and whether campus speech codes have a positive or negative effect. Through court cases, we will examine the debate in this country over what it means to be patriotic and whether patriotism requires Americans to say, or prohibits them from saying, certain things &ndash; and look at how the standards have changed over the years. We will also ask whether other countries&#39; attitudes toward free speech and the other First Amendment freedoms should influence US foreign policy toward those countries. \r\n\r\nExamples of constraints on speech in our daily lives and work, intentional or unwitting, will also be considered, as will the recent trend toward erasing the memory of things in our history that we now find repugnant and removing the names of people responsible for such things, whose reputations are being revised or re-examined, from buildings and programs that long honored them.\r\n\r\nThe sources for our conversations will include both scholarly and popular materials -- writings and statements made by the participants in these debates, a classical treatise on liberty by the political philosopher John Stuart Mill, media reports, commentary by scholars and journalists from different societies and perspectives, as well as your own experiences and conclusions about what you can and cannot, or should and should not, say. \r\n\r\nA brief essay, analyzing the readings and the issues for each session, will be due in class most weeks. There will also be a major paper and a group project, but no final exam. \r\n\r\nSanford J.

This class will provide a critical assessment on how concepts such as state, governance, or sovereignty are constructed and disputed in regions in which multiple political and social allegiances overlap. Students will grasp the wide gap between formal narratives and on-the-ground reality, achieving a more factual and comprehensive understanding of the complexity of these two regions."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "13843", "description": "\r\n    This course is for undergraduate students writing the Latin American Thesis.

Most Latin American countries have willingly sought to diversify their foreign relations, and therefore, have sought to strengthen relations with several extra-regional powers. Since the Monroe Doctrine, the Western Hemisphere has been a sensitive area for the United States, and Washington has always been concerned with the presence of extra-regional powers in the region. The 2017 U.S. National Security Strategy employs sharp language against China and Russia and calls for regional relations that &ldquo;will limit opportunities for adversaries to operate from areas of close proximity to us,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;limits the malign influences of non-hemispheric forces.&rdquo; In this course, we will examine thoroughly the immense effects of China&rsquo;s engagement with the region; we will study the USSR and the Cold War in Latin America, as well as Russia&rsquo;s recent return to the region under Putin. Additionally, we will analyze some historical and new links, such as the ones with EU countries, the Vatican, Japan, India, Israel and Iran, all the while using the comparative method."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "44689", "description": "\r\n    Disorganized Crime, State Capture, and Development in Latin America (1.5 cr. &ndash; GHD)\nProfessor Christopher Johnson\n\nDuring the last decade, homicide rates in El Salvador, Honduras, and Venezuela place those countries only behind Syria and ahead of Afghanistan and other war-torn countries in terms of the risk of violent death. Moreover, narcotics-related violence in Honduras, Mexico, Jamaica, Colombia, and Brazil have been pervasive threats to the well-being of those populations. In some cases, drug trafficking groups have captured parts of the state and, in more extreme examples, have ascended to the highest political office in the country, as is the case for Honduras. This insecurity has spawned major development challenges, such as mass migration, poverty, institutional decay, underinvestment, and lower life expectancy. In national surveys where homicides are high, violence/security is often cited as the top concern for people migrating out of the country. In Central America, violence costs the GDP on average between 11 and 18 percent, diverting limited resources to security and away from job creation, healthcare, social security, and other social priorities. Yet despite these devastating impacts, criminal violence has traditionally been combated especially be national governments by &lsquo;mano dura&rsquo;. That is by imprisoning those that are suspected of being perpetrators which often means young poor men. Governments have used the police and also military to suppress violence often through mass imprisonment however this approach has not resulted in dramatic reductions in violence over the long-term.\n\nThis course is project based but will provide a broad historical overview of the political, economic, and social forces that have allowed gangs and criminal organizations to become integrated into many parts of Latin American and Caribbean societies. The course will use selected countries to provide greater detail as to how these forces have shaped the current trajectories of each country and the varied responses. The course will focus on additional countries that have had innovative responses to addressing gang violence in their country, including gang-mitigation and reinsertion projects as well as adapting traditional development projects in the context of criminal violence. Through project-based work, students will develop a proposal to address the root causes of gang and criminal violence in a Latin American or Caribbean country. The projects developed will draw upon real world examples from the World Bank and other international institutions. Students will present their proposals to World Bank officials who work in security and development in Latin America and the Caribbean for practical feedback."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "42882", "description": "\r\n    This course provides an introduction to basic economic, legal and political concepts related to trade policy.

This advanced seminar will focus on the politics of human rights and challenges to effective protection of human rights.  In order to gain some depth in relation to the issues that could be addressed, the seminar will delve into only four themes or types of human rights violations:  enforced disappearance; deprivation of liberty (and inhuman treatment and torture); executions (right to life); and violence against women.  Selected Latin American countries will be used to explore these themes, including Argentina, Colombia and M&eacute;xico.  The primary regional focus of the course will be on Latin America; however, the seminar will use material arising out of other contexts, such as Indonesia and the United States of America.  Cross-regional and comparative analysis is also encouraged in discussions and research.  \n\nCourse reading draws on relevant literatures in political science, social sciences and law, including textbooks, academic articles, legal decisions, and international treaties and other legal instruments.  Legal training is not required.  Readings also include in-depth reporting and expos&eacute;s on major human rights events in Latin American countries.  Complementarily, we will view films (fiction and documentary) that offer a vivid perspective of the problems being analyzed. Throughout the course we will consider the practical dimensions of human rights activism, and the legal and policy implications of the subjects studied.\n\nDebates will concentrate on dilemmas that arise out of human rights practice, focusing on the fissure between standard-setting exercises and national implementation, and the growing gap between rhetoric and practice. We will review the role of the state in relation to development of international human rights law and reflect on the way the state has managed to fade as the object of concern of this (once state-centered) branch of international law."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "34252", "description": "\r\n    This course will focus on U.S. foreign policy in Latin America and the relationship between the U.S. and the other countries in the Hemisphere."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "18092", "description": "\r\n    Culture and Power in Latin America: Explores the changing and contested constructions of identities and belief systems among the diverse peoples of Latin America.
