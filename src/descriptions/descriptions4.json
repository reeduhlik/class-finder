In 1933 there were 40 million Protestants, 20 million Catholics, and small numbers of people adhering to other Christian traditions. Germany&#39;s territorial expansion that began in the 1930&#39;s meant millions of people, Christian and Jewish, came to be under the control of the Nazi state. The German Army, or Wehrmacht (1935-1945) became a tool for vast territorial expansion, and, in some cases, for war crimes and murder of civilians and Jews. How did Catholics in the Wehrmacht see and understand their role? Why did some participate while others refused to do so, even at the cost of their own lives? This course will examine the role of Catholics in the Wehrmacht, including its crimes against Jews and other civilians. We will examine photographs, diary excerpts and film to come to a closer understanding of the inner lives and decisions of Catholic soldiers.

This course will focus on the times, places and literatures that reflect the interface between paganism as it has evolved within the Greco-Roman world and nascent Judaism and Christianity. It pushes toward an understanding of how Judaism and Christianity emerged out of the Hebrew-Israelite-Judaean tradition as two forms of faith each claiming to be the proper continuation of that tradition. It considers how their theological relationship&mdash;their competition regarding the Truth regarding divinity and its relationship to humanity&mdash;is not only affected by their mutual interface and their theological relationships with paganism but by the political context of the pagan Roman Imperium in which they both develop. This is a world of meeting, divergence, convergence, synthesis, embrace and rejection of religious principles and ideas. It is a world in which verbal distinctions that we take for granted&mdash;such as those between magic and religion, myth and theology, superstition and true belief, astronomy and astrology&mdash;have not yet assumed the place to which they arrived within our vocabulary, over time.

One basic point to understand about the conflict is that it is not a morality play. One side is not all right and the other all wrong. That is not to say that they are equally responsible for what has happened, but it is to say that both have suffered and both would benefit enormously from ending the conflict and its animating grievances. \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWe will explore why each side tends to see the world the way it does, and why mythologies have taken hold of all sides and made reality hard to grasp. We will examine narratives of the Israelis, the Palestinians, and the Arabs more generally. Mindsets must be understood in any negotiation, and we will look at what shaped each side&rsquo;s approach to the conflict historically as well as its approach to conflict resolution over the periods of the most intensive diplomacy. We will analyze how close the efforts in the year 2000 came to ending the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians and Israelis and Syrian, and will discuss what lessons must be learned from the past in order to shape a different future. \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWe will also consider the American role as well as that of outside parties in trying to resolve the conflict.

The first session sets out the issues of the course, discusses the current situation of Muslims and Jews in Europe today, and provides a background on antisemitism, islamophobia and philosemitism. The next two sessions offer an overview of the premodern and modern European context and the geopolitics of religious conflict. This will include discussion of the Crusades, the wars of religion of the 16th century, the impact of Enlightenment thought and of colonialism. This period witnessed the emancipation of Jews, rising antisemitism and encounters between the Western world and Muslim societies.

The aim of this course is to promote a more comprehensive understanding and familiarity with the social science literature and approaches that have been used to study a key and vital region in international politics and the emerging global economy and polity."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "34636", "description": "\r\n    The capstone for the M.A. in Latin American Studies is a three-credit course that provides graduate students with an opportunity to demonstrate their comprehensive, integrated and interdisciplinary knowledge about Latin America and the Caribbean applied to a specific analytical question, case study, policy issue, new opportunity, emerging challenge, or project chosen by students in their respective concentrations. The outcome of the capstone course should be a professional deliverable that students can either use as a gateway to their professional careers upon graduation or as a means to advance in their current professions. Students should expect to be spending approximately 10-15 hours per week devoted to the capstone project, executing an applied, professional experience to conclude the Masters program."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "42663", "description": "\r\n    Data and Inference for Policymakers\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nPolicymakers hear and make causal claims all the time:\no &ldquo;Conditional cash transfers reduce short- and long-term poverty&rdquo;\no &ldquo;Stay-at-home policies prevented the spread of Covid-19&rdquo;\no &ldquo;Community policing initiatives increase trust in local government&rdquo;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nHow do we assess the validity of those claims? In this course, you will learn to &ldquo;think with data.&rdquo; The course will provide you with three core skills: basic competency in data manipulation and visualization (using R), intro-level familiarity with probability and statistics, and counterfactual thinking/analysis. The course assumes little or no background in statistics or quantitative analysis, but is aimed at training policymakers who are confident consuming, evaluating, and drawing conclusions from research.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nBecause these skills are likely new to the students, they require significant practice. The first half of each class (about 1 hour) will provide theoretical background on key concepts, mostly through lecture. The second half of the class will be devoted to developing the inferential toolkit through partnered practice. The problem sets aim to link these two skills by having students work through applied examples from the policy world. Because the course is housed in Latin American Studies, these examples will come primarily from that region, but the lessons and tools are broadly applicable.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nPRE-REQUISITES\nThere are no prerequisites for masters students to take this class. If you are an undergraduate interested in taking this class, you must contact the department for approval."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "43758", "description": "\r\n    This seminar is designed to guide students in the process of applied qualitative research for the design, collection, processing and analysis of information. The seminar starts with the design of a research question and a strategy based on a creative process that will allow students to identify challenges in the design of a research project. For the design phase, students will learn different research tools such as ethnographic interviews, participant observation and focus groups. They will also learn how to best identify the most appropriate tools to operationalize their research."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "11868", "description": "\r\n    \r\n    "},
