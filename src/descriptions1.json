Students will be guided through the methods of Buffett by applying his methods under various scenarios. As the course has a practical orientation a case-based approach will be followed to gain understanding.\r\n\r\nThe course shall proceed in several parts. To begin, the course shall undertake an exploration of why the Graham, Dodd, Buffett value oriented philosophy and its practitioners have disproportionally and consistently out-performed all other methodologies from a historical standpoint. Second, the course shall undertake to describe the search methods of Warren Buffett and consider both where and under what circumstances give rise to great opportunities. Concepts drawn from the field of behavioral economics will be introduced to build awareness of the systematic biases that motivate the behavior of market participants and how an informed observer can take advantage of them. Third we shall focus on the valuation method employed by Buffett and compare that to more traditional valuation methods such as the discounted cash flow model. Forth, after rendering a quantitative valuation of a firm we shall undertake a qualitative evaluation of the opportunity to determine if there exists in the words of Buffett &ldquo;a durable competitive advantage&rdquo; with an understanding that such advantages are fundamentally rooted in the strategic economics of the company in question. The course will also touch upon the question of growth and the types of growth that are likely to add value. Finally, the course shall address the question of risk management and awareness of personal biases in the evaluation of opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe course is geared for those who wish to work in the area of buy-side investments be it investment management, private client wealth management and family offices, private equity, investment analysis and portfolio management or for the purposes of developing one&rsquo;s own personal investing strategy.

That responsibility demands a particular set of products primarily provided by a rather specialized industry well versed in the business of selling weapons and military equipment to the government. The primary customer (and often times,sole customer) for defense related products is the DoD. The Congress, which provides the DoD with their funding to buy the equipment, largely determines the size of the market by how much budget they appropriate and authorize each year. Most uniquely, new products sold in this market are developed at the request and oversight of both the DoD customer and the Congress. \n\nOperating a business that competes in this highly regulated market requires different business development and marketing approaches. Program managers have a very different challenge to developing, manufacturing and then selling their products. The customer also plays an integral partnership role in the research and development of new products, often times sharing the financial risk of bringing a new product to market. While Fortune 100 defense firms such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman dominate the market, an ecosystem of smaller businesses also offer unique solutions to specific defense related problems. Whether large or small, however, any company that seeks to earn business with the DoD must navigate a cumbersome, frustratingly complicated defense acquisition process that requires long-suffering patience before realizing a profit&mdash;a unique market barrier that dissuade many other businesses. \n\nThis course is suited for students seeking to understand the fundamentals of the US defense industry&mdash;how market demand is generated, how customer funding works, and how business transaction is consummated.

This course is designed to give you practical experience in using modern analytical instrumentation and to provide you with the background theory and principles of operation. As such, it has both a laboratory and lecture component. In the lectures you will learn about the chemical or physical principles used during the measurement, how the instrument actually takes the measurement and some of the techniques used to increase accuracy, precision and sensitivity. Topics to be covered in lecture include: spectroscopy, electrochemistry, NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, chromatography, and electro-separations.\nIn the laboratory, you will put this knowledge into practice by performing various experiments designed to provide examples of the usefulness of the particular instrument or technique. As in many chemistry classes, you must develop good physical manipulation skills. However, it is important to remember that many different types of a particular instrument exist. We don&#39;t want you to be an &quot;expert&quot; on one instrument but learn the operating principles of the technique so that you will be able to understand and operate a wide range of instruments based on this knowledge. Most people who follow a scientific career will use instruments at some time to take measurements of various chemical or physical properties. Even people who follow a non-scientific career will often need to interpret data and assess its quality (accuracy and reliability) and determine if the data was recorded in a sensible way using an appropriate instrument. ."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "41625", "description": "\r\n    Starting in the junior year, each honors program student undertakes and completes an original research project which becomes the basis of the senior honors thesis.

Confucianism starts with a challenge to each and every person to improve themselves and to extend the scope of their moral concern from themselves and their immediate family and friends to neighbors, society, and eventually the world at large. The ultimate aim is to move from the individual to &ldquo;all under heaven&rdquo; and bring peace, prosperity, and happiness to all.\n\nIn this class we shall ask, how accurate, plausible, and complete are the theories of human nature that underlie the ethical thought of different Confucian philosophers? Do such theories find any support from the best psychology and cognitive neuroscience of our day? Moreover, are the normative moral claims Confucians derive from their theories of human nature universally valid, merely one variation among many possible forms of society and culture, or without any normative force (i.e. incapable of justifying the moral claims they make)?\n\nIn order to achieve the ends described in the previous paragraph, this course will describe, analyze, and evaluate the theories of the two most important early followers of Kongzi (Confucius): Mengzi (Mencius) and Xunzi from the perspective of both modern science and comparative philosophy.

The genre of science fiction historically has been a medium through which authors organize their comments about human life in fantastic imaginative contexts.  Science fiction has served allegorically to provide readers and spectators the opportunity to consider topics of social life and subjectivity, politics and power, identity, eros and sexuality, language and communication, the nature of historical change, the environment, etc.  Science fiction does this by anchoring its fantasies to science and, more particularly, to technology.  Indeed, the expressive medium of film can itself be understood as a newer technology--one now almost 125 years old--through which modern societies have considered the utopian and dystopian possibilities for human life and related technologies in individual and social contexts.\n\nOrganized around three themes&mdash;Bodies and Monsters, Memory, and Machines--the course\nconsiders science fiction film produced in different regional and national spaces, and it does so in order to reconsider assumptions about science fiction film and the varying kinds of artists who embrace the genre for their expressive purposes.\n\nFor the spring 2024 semester, the special theme for the seminar will be on artificial intelligence, and the screenings will include: 2001: A Space Odyssey, Colossus: The Forbin Project, Dark Star, Zardoz, Demon Seed, Electric Dreams, Making Mr. Right, Johnny Mnemonic, Teknolust, Computer Chess, 2046, After Yang, and Ex Machina."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "46390", "description": "\r\n    This course develops skills for the critical analysis of graphic design.

The first part of the course will focus on International trade and some of the popular trade theories. We will explore how trade can be explained by differences in absolute and comparative advantage as seen in the well-known Ricardian model and analyze the effects of trade on income distribution as well as see different sources of gains that arise when countries trade with each other. In addition, we will also study how trade takes place when two countries differ in resources or factor endowments as seen in the Heckscher-Ohlin model. We will also cover certain important issues in trade policy - such as the benefits and costs of tariffs, subsidies and trade quotas, that accrue to countries using these instruments. The second part of the course will cover some key concepts and issues in international macroeconomics, such as exchange rates, balance of payments, trade and financial accounts, exchange rate regimes. In particular, we will focus on some pertinent questions such as what causes countries to run trade surpluses or deficits with their trading partners? How are such imbalances resolved over time? What causes banking and currency crises in open economies? What \nfactors are responsible for financial contagion between economies, and how can governments handle international financial instability?

Do these policies have a direct impact on income inequality and, if so, to what extent does this impact detract from the growth benefits? The course will begin with some evidence on the growth effects of structural reforms and financial openness, and the patterns of growth in emerging market and developing economies.
