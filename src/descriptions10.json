The 50 State Legislatures across America are praised as the &ldquo;laboratories&rdquo; of American government, testing out innovative policies while the U.S. Congress is mired in partisan gridlock. In fact the earliest State Legislatures predate Congress by a hundred years, and Adams, Jefferson and Franklin, all drew on their experiences in their assemblies of\nMassachusetts, Virginia and Pennsylvania, when they designed the role of Congress in the U.S. Constitution. Despite their important historic and continuing role in American government, State Legislatures are arguably the least studied and understood element in the U.S. political landscape.\n\nThis course will look at the pressures and tensions driving individual members of the various Legislatures around the nation. For example, how can a candidate shift from attacking his opponent in the other party to building consensus to pass legislation? What balance should a Representative strike between responsibility to constituents, the entire population of the State and personal judgement and conscience? We will also look at the challenges behaving ethically, while being forced to raise ever larger campaign war chests.\n\nIn the second part of the course, we will look at the various State Legislatures throughout the nation, and consider why these institutions have developed structures and traditions so differently from one another.

That same New Hampshire House member represents only 3,350 constituents, while a California House member represents 493,750 people. While most states struggle with often bitter partisan battles and tension between House and Senate members, Nebraska organizes on a non-partisan basis and dispenses with the House altogether, with a 49 member Senate as its sole legislative body.\n\nFinally, in the third section of the course, we will look in detail at creating, negotiating and enacting legislation from a practical point of view. Where do lobbyists, staff and legislative leaders fit in? Why is it so difficult to pass a bill? What are the secrets to successfully fighting through to getting a bill passed and signed?\n\nI will be drawing on my 20 years experience as a State Representative in the PA House and with the Council of State Governments, which provides a forum for those legislators from around the country to share best practices.

These dilemmas come after a period of unusual consensus after World War II over the organization and responsibilities of U.S. government Departments and Agencies, as well as the nature of the U.S. national security threats they were designed to address. With respect to the U.S., its leadership &ndash; and actions &ndash; since 1991 raises profound questions about the current global order and what is a realistic role for the U.S. in the future.\n\nThis context also makes understanding long-standing (and stressed) fundamentals, mechanics and workings of the U.S. interagency system vital for national security professionals. Implementing and operationalizing national security policy now and in the future will be further complicated by knowing how to define what is truly a national security challenge to the U.S. and how to prioritize efforts to address those challenges.\n\nContemporary examples of such challenges are plentiful: Russia&rsquo;s naked aggression, the invasion of Ukraine and the rising specter of the use of nuclear weapons; Chinese ambitions vis-&agrave;-vis Taiwan, expansion in the South China Sea and its increasing power projection and competition with the U.S.; countering Iranian &ldquo;malign&rdquo; influence and continued pursuit of a nuclear weapon; Sunni extremist non-state actors (Al Qaeda, Al Shabbab, and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria); continuing political and ethnic instability across Africa; and the proliferation of capabilities with application to cyberweapons and weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWith the above in mind, this course will focus on: (i) defining national security, understanding the theoretical underpinnings of national security, and reviewing the United States&rsquo; national security framework and processes; (ii) examining key national security issues over the past seventy years, reviewing the decision making processes in developing policies to address these issues, and evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of those policies; and (iii) applying the course review of national security policy making processes and substantive national security areas of concern (historical and contemporary) into a written and practical exercise context.\n\nThis course will place both bureaucratic mechanics and substantive issues into an operational framework that will enable students to understand and appreciate their implications for U.S. and international security, as well as having the students consider tangible ends, ways and means to address this evolving national security landscape."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "46155", "description": "\r\n    U.S. civil, military, and commercial space activities are significant contributors to our nation&#39;s economic, scientific, and national security interests.

The course presents policy analysis as a clinical profession in which practitioners search for diagnoses that explain less acceptable outcomes, and then build on those diagnoses to formulate interventions designed to yield better outcomes. There are four major units to the course. Unit one focuses on general aspects of policy analysis and works through a major example. Unit two covers a wide range of process models useful for diagnosing why less acceptable outcomes occur. Unit three develops skills at constructing theories of change (also known as logic models), as informed by process models, that become the basis for concrete policy alternatives. Unit three also presents methods for forecasting the consequences of interventions and justifying recommendations. Unit four focuses on how to use data, analysis and well-crafted exhibits to convey recommendations effectively into policymaking processes that are overwhelmed with competing messages. Throughout the course, students will spend nearly every session doing policy analysis in class, with hands-on coaching by a professional policy analyst who works as an independent consultant to governments and nonprofit organizations.

This course provides a framework for developing new approaches to building things&mdash;products, programs, policies, organizations&mdash;that better serve people.\n\nThis course is focused on understanding how the same methodology (Human-Centered Design) that firms use to design and build revolutionary products can be (and is being) applied in government to deliver better outcomes to the public.\n\nDesign is not just making things pretty&mdash;it is a critical approach to problem-solving. In recent years, as the value of design for addressing complex human problems has grown in popularity, many have tried to structure and package design as a repeatable process. Yet what is especially effective about design is that it is actually not a linear process. As a creative endeavor, it is really more of a framework that provides an environment in which creative chaos can unfold, and eventually yield clarity in the form of a solution/hypothesis that can be verified.\n\nDeep understanding creates the foundation for creative exploration, which in turn leads to a hunch/hypothesis/concept that is then tested, refined, and implemented. While the staying power of the exact terminology (like &ldquo;Human-Centered Design&rdquo; and &ldquo;Design Thinking&rdquo;) remains to be seen, this basic framework has existed throughout human history and has gone by different names. Whatever label we put on it, it is a core competency of creative problem solving.\n\nThe goal of this course is to prepare students for working creatively in a policy environment, and finding new solutions to complex human problems, in a manner that prioritizes people over politics and bureaucracy. To this end, the course takes a blended and hands-on approach to learning, combining reading and lectures with design studios, and guest speakers who will provide a first-hand narrative of their experience with innovation in government.\n\nWhat is a design studio? A design studio is a problem-solving workshop rooted in design principles. The word &ldquo;design&rdquo; does not indicate visual design. &ldquo;Design&rdquo; in this context signifies a particular approach to problem-solving which is the foundation of much of the work currently underway in government. The Stanford d.school and IDEO have championed the studio in their work.\n\nWhat will we be doing in the studio? We will use studio time to apply the principles and methodologies we learn to a specific problem that students face. This will include a &ldquo;Discovery Sprint,&rdquo; interviews, synthesis, and prototyping.\n\nStudents who take this course will become familiar with:\n\nThe definition of Human-Centered Design\nHow / why HCD is useful in a policy environment\nThe difference between &ldquo;big D&rdquo; and &ldquo;small d&rdquo; design\nDesign principles, and why design is critical to our ability to effectively solve complex human problems\nHow design can be used to develop better policies, programs, services, and products\nWhy design is an effective risk mitigation strategy\nThe &ldquo;product&rdquo; mindset\nHow agile can help government develop the right solutions for people, save money, and avoid massive risk"}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "30822", "description": "\r\n    This course will engage students with the design, collection, and evaluation of the methodological approaches we commonly think of as &ldquo;qualitative,&rdquo; emphasizing interview-based research, ethnography, and comparative research.

Enormous infrastructure projects, such as mines, dams, highways, and transoceanic canals, attract huge investments and drive major socio-environmental changes, encompassing deforestation and community displacement. While these impacts are well-documented, numerous proposed initiatives remain unrealized. These halted developments can have far-reaching consequences, even influencing legislation and policies. A thorough analysis of these unimplemented projects is crucial, demanding interdisciplinary study that integrates academic and decision-makers&#39; perspectives.\nThe course delves into the socio-environmental impacts of major stalled or canceled infrastructure projects using real-world cases, covering topics like technological and socio-environmental assessments, legal challenges, public opposition, and escalating costs. Illustrative examples include projects in Chile, Costa Rica, Canada, Panama, Colombia, the United States, and Nicaragua. The course scrutinizes the enduring effects of unrealized infrastructure projects, including their influence on research, societal norms, activism, land utilization, and equity. It provides an interdisciplinary perspective on development, governance, policy, knowledge, and environmental change. Emphasizing the necessity of studying even these unrealized projects, underscores their long-lasting impact on societies and landscapes. Students gain insights into the dynamics of development, power, and socio-environmental changes, not only in low and middle-income nations but also in Canada and the United States. This focus on their potential impact is vital for international lending and development organizations, as well as for global security and governance&mdash;an essential perspective for students interested in the field of STI policies. This course is essential for equipping students with the knowledge and skills needed to address evolving global challenges, such as climate change and global security, by mitigating the socio-environmental impacts of infrastructure projects and promoting sustainability. The course comprises four units: Introduction and case background, reasons for project disruptions, socio-environmental consequences of unrealized projects, and the global impact of unimplemented projects. Students will:\nAnalyze STI policies&#39; role in preventing project disruptions and propose effective solutions. Explore how innovative technologies can lead to sustainable infrastructure development.

Further, the way health systems and larger political systems are structured directly impact the ability to prepare for, manage, and respond to, large scale public health threats. The failure to act has implications not just on health, but on the daily lives and the economy of a system. Yet, preparation, management, and response &ndash; both at the national and international level &ndash; bears political, financial, and arguably, individual, costs. The pandemic has painfully highlighted this systemic under-resourcing of health systems, as well as the reality that common multilateral financial responses are incommensurate with the need and health burden at hand.

Africa&rsquo;s digital revolution can be attributed to demand from a youthful population, increased digitization and digital transformation and increased investment in innovative products. That said, there are pervasive challenges such as poor critical infrastructure, a wide digital divide and skills gaps. While the tech sector has positioned itself to help solve Africa&rsquo;s challenges, there is inconclusive evidence on the sustainability of such corporate social impact and the sector&rsquo;s role in solving systemic challenges. As such, the class will examine the market systems approach to development and how to leverage the corporate sector for good.\n\nAfrica&rsquo;s fast adoption of technology for development provides a shift from typical &ldquo;brick and motor&rdquo; business models that focused on the construction of dated infrastructure and the distribution of goods, to one that leapfrogs and focuses on leaning in to the Fourth Industrial Revolution, a rising gig economy, increasing local manufacturing thus providing Africans with additional agency to craft their own progress.\n\nThis course will introduce broad topics related to Africa&rsquo;s development at the intersection of business, development and technology. Students will study factors relevant to the tech sector&rsquo;s success such as geopolitical influences such as China&rsquo;s digital belt road, cyber and information technology security, ethical considerations in product development and evolving legal frameworks.

A rapidly changing technology environment and growing excitement about &ldquo;big data&rdquo; have resulted in unprecedented collection and release of information as made famous by Wikileaks. These contemporary developments are bringing the role of technology and information in governance to sharp focus. This class will explore information technologies ranging from paper and mobile phones to body-worn cameras, the TOR network and drones in varying political contexts including the British colonial empire, the largest social security program (India&#39;s National Rural Employment Guarantee Act), &ldquo;liberation technologies&rdquo; in Latin America and civic technologies in the US. Students will i) critically evaluate existing theories on information technology and governance and ii) develop their own understanding of how state, technology and society interact iii) apply their understanding to a case of their own choosing. The course is intended for students who want to design technology solutions, create or inform technology policy, and/or understand how technology is changing the nature of information, society and governance. For their final project, students will be asked to reflect on an information and technology based solution to a governance problem that they develop, or critically write about an existing information technology based approach in a governance context. \n\nLearning goals: \n\n1)You will learn how to systematically think differently about how the state, technology and governance. \n\n2)Critical understanding of existing theories on information and technology as they are related to addressing global governance challenges.\n\n3)Conceive, develop and present a final paper and project. \n\n4)Develop a sense of critical reflection while engaging in technical interventions.

Science and technology are increasingly critical to national security, and national security concerns will increasingly shape the scientific enterprise. Policymakers must develop the knowledge, best practices, and tools to help advance scientific research, promote technologies that help solve urgent global challenges, and safeguard the fundamental values at the heart of the social contract. Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and advanced computing, biotechnologies and biomanufacturing, communication and networking technologies, and renewable energy generation and storage are poised to transform decision making from the boardroom to the battlefield. Policymakers must not only adapt to this new strategic environment, but also anticipate the most salient trends and shape them accordingly. \n \nIn many ways, technology statecraft today is more complex and cross-cutting than in the past. It is not just governments that matter but also private companies, academic researchers, philanthropies, and state and local governments who are funding, inventing, and deploying cutting-edge technology. Intensifying geopolitical competition and rapid advances in science and technology require policymakers to employ an array of tools to influence the design, development, and deployment of critical and emerging technologies. Leaders must operate at the seams of foreign and domestic policy, balance national security and economic priorities, and integrate diverse perspectives across foundational sectors of our societies. They must devise policy under conditions of limited resources and mounting transnational challenges, while also navigating growing strategic competition among the major powers. Tradeoffs and tensions are inevitable, but the demand for wise policy and strategy leadership is indispensable. \n \nThis course is organized in three parts. First, we will explore the tools that protect sensitive technologies and slow down competitors: export controls, investment screening, and economic sanctions. Next, we will grapple with the tools that promote technological innovation and help nations run faster: investments in research and development, support for public-private partnerships, and greater government action around a modern industrial and innovation strategy. Finally, we will consider the tools that project influence, foster greater technology situational awareness, and enable the rapid adoption of new capabilities: diplomacy and arms control, international technical standards, and horizon scanning of the global science and technology landscape.

China has effectively divided and neutralized ASEAN. And there remain a host of human security issues including political violence, the politicization of security forces, attacks on ethnic minorities, including wholesale ethnic cleansing, threats posed by transnational criminal syndicates. Arguably the greatest security threat to the region comes from climate change which is already causing changes immigration patterns and impacting food security. \n\nSoutheast Asian states are keen to avoid being forced to choose between the United States and China, as competition between the two intensifies. Mosts states do see the United States as a benign superpower that has created the conditions for their growth and prosperity. But the United States is unable to compete with China on the economic front. China is the largest trading partner of every country in Southeast Asia, and its Belt and Road Initiative and new economic institutions carry weight in a region that is hungry for infrastructure development. More importantly the United States, under the current administration, looks to be a very inconsistent and unreliable ally and partner, unwilling to provide collective goods.

As men often take on more prominent and violent roles within terrorist groups, women&rsquo;s contributions to violent extremism can often be underplayed, underexplored, and misunderstood. Despite the constant repetition of narratives surrounding women&rsquo;s inherent peacefulness, research has shown that women involved in violent extremism provide logistical support, lend reputation to a cause, facilitate recruitment, and increase group stability. Moreover, gendered approaches to recruitment, processes of radicalization, and the roles that women can play in preventing violent extremism (PVE) and countering violent extremism (CVE) processes are less understood. From theoretical foundations to policy implications, this course will address pressing terrorism threats to national and international security with an often overlooked gender lens.\n\nThis course will explore gender dynamics in radicalization, conflict (as victims and perpetrators), and disengagement.

Contrary to the common assumption that trafficking in humans, drugs, and weapons takes place only in weak states with corrupt law-enforcement personnel, in reality both weak and strong economies are linked to global criminal activities. This course explores the phenomenon of combatting illicit drugs that are harvested in weaker economies but consumed in wealthier societies, while arms are manufactured in industrialized nations and smuggled to conflict zones. Humans, in the meantime, are sold for labor and sexual exploitation across all societies, independent of economic wealth.\n\nA large part of the course will be dedicated to understanding how and why various forms of trafficking overlap. Taking case studies from ISIS in the Maghreb to Cartel Jalisco in Mexico and MS-13 in greater Washington, DC, this course will challenge students to compare and contrast characteristics of criminal and terrorist activities, the growing intersection between drugs and human trafficking, and the inevitable role of states, both weak and strong, in facilitating illicit activity.\n\nTo understand how violence and illicit activity are related, the course will also dig deeper with discussions of the human condition as embedded in complex social relationships and institutions. For instance, to understand the phenomenon of human trafficking on a micro level &ndash; why humans exploit other humans &ndash; the course will draw from literature on colonialism and social stratification. To understand the phenomenon of criminal behavior, the course will examine which pathways push radicalization into violent behavior. Finally, the course will explore why some forms of terror, like the disappearance or disfigurement of a human body, are particularly widespread in illicit economies. Incorporating these sociological dimensions will allow for more informed academic inquiry into security and trafficking and deliberate policy recommendations.\n\nThe course has a strong policy dimension, and students will be required to formulate policy recommendations to alleviate societies from illicit activities, both in the United States and in other parts of the world. During the first half of the course, students will learn about various forms of trafficking and transnational illicit activity. In the second half, students will examine transnational trends &ndash; from smuggling humans, drugs, and arms on the U.S.-Mexican border, to terrorism financing by ISIS, and the global offshore financial markets offering to launder money.

Grand strategies are meant to weave the military, political, diplomatic, economic, and other threads of national power into a coherent plan to achieve a country&rsquo;s goals by a well-defined means-ends chain.\n\n\n\nInevitably, reality diverges from that theoretical concept. Many countries fail to achieve such integration. Often that results in their defeat in war or other forms of strategic failure. Other countries succeed despite similar failings. Likewise, while the successful pursuit of a grand strategy has often produced victory, history is littered with policy gambits that failed despite being driven by well-oiled grand strategies.\n\n\n\nStill, since policymakers should not embark on major undertakings in expectation that they will just get lucky, a well-reasoned, well-executed grand strategy is vital when nations seek to accomplish important foreign policy goals. Indeed, the best judge of the soundness of any foreign policy endeavor should be whether it is backed by a reasonable, feasible grand strategy&mdash;or if it is part of such an overarching conception.\n\n\n\nFor these reasons, the course will focus on the conception, integration, and implementation of the strands of a grand strategy. The key to any grand strategy is how well its many dimensions work in unison in pursuit of a common theory of victory, and ultimately toward the national goal. Of course, ensuring that the many components of a government implement the various aspects of a grand strategy for which each is responsible is enormously difficult. It is hard enough for many leaders and governments to articulate a rational, coherent grand strategy; it is harder still for them to see that all of the agencies, bureaucracies, parties, and people of their government actually execute it.\n\n\n\nThe course is meant to help students recognize both strengths and flaws in grand strategies.

While Turkey joined NATO nearly 70 years ago, US and Brussels need to recognize that they are in an existential head-to-head competition with Russia and Iran. If Washington does not play to win &ndash; Moscow and Tehran will extract even more unearned advantages.\n\n \n\nHow did we get here? What defines modern hot wars and terrorism? What constitutes an alliance? How do we regain dominance in a region that 19th century diplomats called &ldquo;The Eastern Question?&rdquo;  What policies, strategies, and courses of action will reset the shot clock? Five key issues complicate short- and long-term answers to US policy options and engagement strategies with Turkey.  Students will explore strategies that aim to address each of them.\n\n&bull;   First, Turkey has acquired Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missiles that pose direct threats to NATO F-35 and other aircraft as well as other NATO assets and personnel in the region.  While this is not the first time Turkey has flirted with Russia - and not the first time the US has closed the door to arms sales - it is the first time NATO has had to confront Russian air, land, and sea forces that are now based in Syria under long-term agreements. \n\n&bull;   Second, the US decision in the 2010s to train, arm, and advise Syrian-based Kurdish People&rsquo;s Protection Units (YPG) so that they could help drive ISIS from its &ldquo;self-proclaimed&rdquo; caliphate in Raqqa and challenge Bashar al-Assad drew immediate and sustained reactions from Turkey because at least some YPG members were affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers&rsquo; Party (PKK). This issue remains largely unresolved, and it is an unrelenting source of high and enduring tension in the region.\n\n&bull;   Third, while formal US policy supports a unity Iraq, the US has walked a tight rope with Ankara each time the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government (and its predecessors) has attempted to gain more autonomy or independence from Baghdad (1970, 1991, 2005 and 2017).  Sustained US diplomatic, military, and intelligence relations with the IRG have exacerbated mistrust in Ankara.  Adding to these turbulent waters are historic and ongoing ties between the PUK and KDP with the PKK and with Iran. \n\n&bull;   Fourth, the prolonged wars in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, along with instability in Lebanon, have created opportunities for Iran and Hizballah to exert military and sectarian &ldquo;soft power&rdquo; influence well beyond its borders.  Turkey, home to the last Sunni Caliphate, has complained about growing Shia activism.  The broader NATO alliance has struggled to adapt to Iran&rsquo;s expanding power in the Middle East &ndash; and its nuclear weapons ambitions that are accelerating. \n\n&bull;   Fifth, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has jailed at least 100,000 government employees, journalists, scholars, and protesters who have questioned his policies, corruption, and ruling style.  He remains convinced - without credible evidence - that the USG worked behind the scenes with Pennsylvania-based Fethullah G&uuml;len to inspire or support the July 2016 failed coup attempt.  The US has not been successful in countering Turkey&rsquo;s propaganda and harmful narrative on this point in part because of credible analytic judgments that, according to US Ambassador Jim Jeffrey, point clearly to G&uuml;len.\n\nThis class uses two teaching methods. Before the mid-term, students will learn about key historic events and apply them to current issues that unfold during the semester.  After the mid-term paper, students will apply what they have learned while playing assigned roles as the DNI/DCIA or the Secretaries of State, Defense, and Treasury.  Students will learn in each role how to write short, cogent, persuasive one-page memos to the President each week.  They will gain practice and confidence delivering their written points in short oral briefings as our classroom becomes a simulated White House Situation Room."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "34441", "description": "\r\n    During the last decade, the Arctic has been transformed from a scientific backwater to a key strategic area for the United States.

Many of the most important insights into modern into the subject first emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. They evolved in sharp debates over the impact of trade and monetary policy. Yet the importance of international economics has never been more important than it is today.Through the international trade of goods and services and the international flow of currencies, the economies of the world&rsquo;s countries have never been more tied to each other. At the same time, the world&rsquo;s economy has never been more turbulent than it is today. Keeping up with the shifting international emvironement has become a central concern of national economic policy makers and statesmen around the world as they contemplate the needs of national security.\n\nThe formal study of economics can correctly be said to have begun with the writings of Adam Smith as an outgrowth of the Scotish Enlightment of the 1700s. With the publication of his major work &ldquo;An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations&rdquo; in 1776 it was immediately recognized as a major work and has influenced public policy ever since. But its clear and direct connection with national security, coming as it did in the early years of the Industrial Revolution has been unmistakable. It was quoted and debated by innumerable writers and thinkers as disparate as Alexander Hamilton and Karl Marx. Since then, the basic concepts have been proven time and again &ndash; though ironically the debate continues to roll on.\n\nOver the last three centuries it has become abundently clear, that the ebbs and flows of ecomomic activity have a direct and across the board impact on national security budgets everywhere. The Pentagon frequently speaks about the concept of DIME, the four elements of national security &ndash; diplomacy, intelligence, military and economics. While they are all important and interrelated, it is clear that the funding of the first three are directly related to the health of a nation&rsquo;s economy.\n\nIn our own lifetimes we have seen this reality dramtically played out. The collapse of the Soviet Union economy ended the Cold War and rendered the former states of that union as second and third tier powers. At the sametime, the sudden and wholly unexpected rise of China has dramatically changed the world&rsquo;s economic, political and military landscape. In many ways, China&rsquo;s rise is a restoration of the historic role that it has played for thousands of years. But it also underscores the importance of economics in the balance of military and political power. At the height of its economic standing in 1800, China was the largest economy in the world. Over the next two hundred years China&rsquo;s economy collapsed to below that of Sudan and with it, became only a bit player in Asian and global affairs. As such, it was easily overrun by the colonial powers of Europe and Japan. China&rsquo;s economic resurgance since the 1980s has once again catapulted China into the dominant political and military power in Asia, easily eclipsing Japan, which for one hundred and fifty years held that distinction. By the same token, it was the stagnation of Japan&rsquo;s economy that allowed China to race past it.\n\nA related issue is also important to note. Both Japan and China were at one time inward looking countries that eschewed foreign contact and trade. While Japan burst out of its insularity and embrased modernity, new ideas and trade relations, China withdrew all the more and allowed its economy to weaken further. Japan prospered and grew in power, while China became an easy mark for the colonial ambitions of both the Western powers and Japan itself. It was only with China&rsquo;s new found openness under Deng Xiaoping that China reversed its two hundred year decline. The lesson could not be more clear: countries that are open to the world prosper and grow in importance while those that close themselves off to the rest of the world are doomed to regression.\n\nThe importance of these lessons is underscored by the resurgence of Asia relative to the West which has enjoyed a two hundred year domination of the internationl order. As Europe&rsquo;s economies shrink in relative importance, the center of power in the world is clearly shifting to the east.\n\nThe aim of this course is to give our students an introduction to the field of international economics as it relates to national power and security which are clearly tightly correlated. It is intended for non-economists. With this in mind, it is our hope to allow our students the become informed consumers of economic thinking to dispel many of the falatious arguments that are often presented in international fora.\n\nIt is important to note that while economics has become extremely mathamatical in the past fifty years, THIS COURSE DOES NOT require a backgound in mathamatics. The book also makes extensive use of graphs. While students are encouraged to delve into them, we will not require a full mastery of those tools.\n\nOne point warrants an early mention. As with all disciplines, international economics carries with it it&rsquo;s own distinct vocabulary. It is imperative that students develop and easy familiarity with that vocabulary. To assist everyone with that endeavor, each class will end with a list of the most important vocabulary words covered in the lesson."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "46211", "description": "\r\n    Foreign Policy for Big Tech is important for students looking to advance their careers in government and corporate public policy or risk management.

It offers a composite picture of Russian national security as it has evolved over the centuries, incorporating culture, geography and political economy and looking at these topics both from within and from without. It traces the internal logic of Russian strategy, the factors that have led Russian policy makers to conceive of national security as they do. It also examines the effect of their logic on the outside world and the many ways in which the outside world has shaped formulations of Russian national security. Starting with medieval Russia, this course winds its way through imperial Russian history, arriving at the caesura of World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution. It then explores the geopolitics of the Soviet Union, from World War II to the arrival of the nuclear age and the Cold War. It details the emergence of Putin&rsquo;s Russia, analyzing Putin&rsquo;s foreign and national-security policies across multiple axes: U.S.-Russia, Russia-Europe, Russia-China, Russia-Middle East and Russia-Ukraine.

We will explore questions such as; What is the relationship between social change (e.g., economic, technological, demographic, geographical&hellip;) and the kinds of culture people produce and consume? Is there something unique about the contemporary America that produces a particular set of cultural practices, and if so what do these practices tell us about the immediate and distant futures of this society? How do everyday actions we take and decisions we make reflect and also shape the culture in which we live in? How aware are we of the structural forces and the relational contexts that guide our decisions? The course will primarily focus on the contemporary American culture, but with a keen awareness of how it is situated within a global context. Course readings and writing assignments will encourage students to question what we so often take for granted, or not recognize as being a powerful force that shapes and situates our everyday actions.

Further, political sociologists are interested in exploring in whose interests is power applied; is the power of the ruling groups a product of the popular will, or is it created/maintained by the powerful themselves through a combination of &ldquo;force&rdquo; and their manipulation of public opinion?  All in all, political sociology explores the relationship between society and politics:  the fundamental ways in which political structures, processes, and decisions are linked to the social structure. \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nStudents should become more aware of the nature and consequences of politics and realize how politics is present in all aspects of social life.  Our approach is historical, global, theoretical, critical, as well as comparative.

We also review major government organizations and programs involved in healthcare, and how key policy issues such as Covid19, insurance expansion under the Affordable Care Act, Medicare reform, drug pricing policy change, and opioid addiction as they affect corporate interests.\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe business of healthcare is presently being disrupted by a range of forces which merit special focus &ndash; as these changes are creating major commercial opportunity for entrepreneurs and established businesses. We will review mergers and acquisitions of healthcare companies &ndash; some pending, some transacted, and some of which have been blocked by the Justice department. On a smaller scale, providers are also merging and aligning to meet the needs of healthcare payers. Technology companies (e.g., Amazon, Google, Oracle) as well as smaller companies (e.g., Epic, Datavant) are also promising to transform this notoriously complicated space. Regulatory and legislative change also cause disruption."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "41797", "description": "\r\n    The antitrust laws of the United States, European Union, China and more than 100 other nations create powerful regulatory constraints on business activity. These laws have been enforced against many of the leading global companies &ndash; Microsoft, Intel, Google, Apple, Facebook, AT&amp;T, IBM, and numerous others &ndash; challenging a wide array of business conduct, ranging from mergers to pricing strategies to allegations of abuse of dominance. This course provides the tools business leaders need to understand competition regulation and factor it into their business decisions. Students will gain an understanding of the fundamentals of antitrust law, economics and policy, including the broader political and economic factors that influence how these laws are applied around the world. We will then explore case studies that focus on key issues in greater depth. For each case, students will examine the nature of the challenged business conduct or strategy; the basis for the regulatory challenge; the outcome of the case and the regulatory risks the case illustrates; and strategies businesses can deploy to mitigate those risks while still advancing their business goals. We will also discuss current policy issues, including how competition policy has factored into the domestic political debate surrounding the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign, and its role in international relationships such as those among the United States, European Union and China. The course is taught by an antitrust lawyer who previously served as antitrust counsel for a global company and who is also a former antitrust enforcer at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "32224", "description": "\r\n    The emergence of the global economy and the multinational enterprise is one of the most significant developments of the past three decades.

Technology disruption and its implication for industries and for jobs and society. Technology has been disrupting companies, industries, and societies for centuries. Big changes began during the industrial revolution of the late 1700&rsquo;s - the agricultural revolution, the manufacturing revolution, and the electronic revolution have all changed enterprises, industries, jobs, and society. Now we are in the early stages of the Fourth Industrial Revolution; a digital world with automated vehicles, robotics, the metaverse, AI, quantum computing, and many other technology advancements some of which we can predict and others that will be developed. These looming technologies will disrupt individual enterprises. Some enterprises will adopt, some will adapt, and many will falter. Whole industries will be created as in the mobile phone industry which began its significant rise in the early 1980&rsquo;s and then was transformed when phones (and other mobile devices) were linked to the internet via fast telecom networks in the mid-2000&rsquo;s. As current and future managers, MBA students can benefit from understanding these technology trends and developments &ndash; how they come about and what their impact is. Several tools will be introduced that can be used to better predict and understand the implications - timing and magnitude - of future technology disruption. And students can benefit from understanding the implications for how work is organized and what jobs are likely to be in demand and whether they will be high-paying or not (job quantity and job quality.) The implications for employers and employees as well as for governments and public policy (for society) and finally for personal careers will be explored."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "38992", "description": "\r\n    This course is about unpacking the implications of the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s actions in a classroom setting.
