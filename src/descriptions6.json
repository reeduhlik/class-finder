As a primary text, we will use Monica Cyrino&rsquo;s Big Screen Rome to get a sense of the film history and sociopolitical contexts of the films, as well as readings in ancient literature that correspond to the films under discussion, including Plutarch&rsquo;s Lives, Suetonius&rsquo; Lives, Tacitus&rsquo; Histories, Plautus&rsquo; plays, and the poetry of Catullus and Horace. We will begin the class with Plautus and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, moving through films including Spartacus, Cleopatra, and Life of Brian, and end with the film The Eagle and episodes in HBO&rsquo;s Rome with readings from Suetonius and Caesar. We will also read short scholarly articles about the production and reactions to the films of the course. In addition to written assignments, such as weekly musings and analysis of secondary sources, we will also complete creative assignments crafting our own reimaginings of Rome in varied formats.

We use language to talk about food, and food terms have rich cultural histories. Menus and food packaging labels provide windows into not only an item&rsquo;s nature and quality, but also the desired customer&rsquo;s identity. People talk while they cook, and while they eat; in fact, mealtime has long been a privileged site for the study of language in use, especially in families. Parents use language to socialize their children into food preferences; even among adults, the taste of food is collaboratively negotiated in interaction (as can be witnessed at a wine or chocolate tasting). People participate in online forums on topics such as gourmet cooking, veganism, and weight loss; they use language about food to portray themselves as certain kinds of people (gourmand or glutton, decadent or disciplined eater). People post brunch photos on Instagram, recipe videos on Facebook, and restaurant reviews on Yelp. Food is a necessity and a luxury; it is intertwined with identities (e.g., cultural, gendered, socioeconomic), relationships (e.g., parent-child, friend-friend), and values (e.g., healthy eating, ethical eating), all of which are negotiated through language.\n\nIn this course, we will explore intersections between language and food by reading research stemming from a range of language-focused perspectives and academic disciplines.

What happens if sound sequences arise (for example by the addition of affixes) that violate the constraints?  What kinds of changes do we typically see (or not)?

Good teaching is not a mystery, but a learnable skill and a rewarding intellectual endeavor.  \r\n\r\nThe course will meet three Tuesdays each month throughout the fall and spring semesters to explore topics in teaching and learning. PhD students who have been awarded fellowships are required to take the Linguistics Teaching Practicum in their first year of study, in preparation for their TA/Instructor assignments. However, all PhD students are encouraged to enroll at some point in their course of study, to develop their pedagogical skills.\r\n\r\nIn addition to investigating best practices of well-known classroom strategies, such as developing lesson plans, lecturing, leading discussions, and designing group projects, we will discuss such questions as &ldquo;What does learner-centered teaching in Linguistics look like?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How do learning styles affect the Linguistics classroom?&rdquo; We will also discuss collaborative learning, different kinds and uses of assessment, and the use of technology in the classroom. \r\n\r\nIn the fall, participants will observe two linguistics classes (a graduate class, in which they may be enrolled, and an undergraduate class), and report on and discuss what they observe.  Participants will also have a frank discussion with current and former graduate student TAs and Instructors about teaching in the Linguistics Department at Georgetown. Each participant will develop a lesson plan and related homework assignment. \r\n\r\nIn the spring, each participant will develop a syllabus for a course of his/her own choosing and a statement of personal teaching philosophy. Each participant will present a teaching demonstration based upon his/her lesson plan; where possible, this demo class will be as a guest instructor in a real course. Participants will videotape themselves, and may discuss their videotape with the instructor. \r\n\r\nMany colleges and universities want evidence of pedagogical training when hiring new faculty. The work products from this course can be included in a teaching portfolio (which is valuable in the academic job search). \r\n\r\nStudents wishing to enroll in the Linguistics Teaching Practicum should register for or add LING 501 in the fall semester, and LING 502 in the spring semester. Tuition is not charged for this course. The workload of the Linguistics Teaching Practicum is targeted to be less than half that of a regular graduate Linguistics course, so that students can take this course in addition to a full courseload.

For some of these scholars, these research sites offer intriguing real-life contexts in which their favorite discourse phenomena can be examined in situ; others are lured by a concrete place in which they can investigate the role of language in the relationship between ideology and practice; still others are attracted by an opportunity to work towards the solution of important societal problems, such as those found in relationships (and discourse) between teachers and their students, judges and jury members, employers and their employees, and health care providers and their patients.\r\n\r\nIn Institutional Discourse, you will have multiple opportunities to build on your knowledge and practice of discourse analysis by exploring some of the intriguing regions in which institutions and discourse intersect.  During the first few weeks of the course, we will read and discuss both classic and current studies by interactional sociolinguists, conversation analysts, ethnographers, and sociologists (see list below for sample readings) in order to familiarize ourselves with the wide range of notions and phenomena addressed by scholars in the field of institutional discourse.  Such topics may include: narratives in institutions; intertextuality; identity construction; &lsquo;talking an institution into being&rsquo;; institutional gatekeeping encounters; &lsquo;total&rsquo; institutions; front- and backstage in institutions; frame-shifting; facework and linguistic politeness; epistemic stance; language and power/agency; discourse shaping effects of professional codes of ethics and principles; and the interrelationships between professional and institutional discourses.\r\n\r\nAgainst this backdrop, you will design and carry out an investigation of the discourse associated with a particular institutional context, typically within the areas of education, law, business, or medicine, although others may certainly be explored.  Projects may examine discourse along a variety of dimensions, including:  1) inter-professional, intra-professional or professional-lay discourse; 2) face-to-face, computer-mediated/web-based, telephone or snail mail encounters; 3) spoken or written discourse; 4) public or private discourse; 5) monologic, dialogic or multi-party discourse; and 6) type of speech activity or event.

This is a real shame, since tonal phenomena present problems that are as interesting, as challenging, and as beautiful as any others in phonology. In this course, we&rsquo;ll take a look at some of these problems, and consider what they can teach us about modern phonological theory.\r\nThe course will proceed in two parallel threads. On the one hand, we&rsquo;ll be looking at particular tonal phenomena from a broad typological perspective. For example, we&rsquo;ll consider processes such as tone spreading (e.g. ??? ? ????) and tone shift (??? ? ???) in a wide variety of languages, and we&rsquo;ll try to arrive at general answers to questions like\r\n\r\n&bull;\tWhat motivates tone spread and shift, and what is the synchronic relationship between the two (if any?)\r\n&bull;\tWhy do tones sometimes spread/shift in a bounded domain (within two or three syllables) while others spread/ shift unboundedly over any number of syllables?\r\n&bull;\tWhat positions within a word attract (or repel) spreading or shifting tones?\r\n&bull;\tWhat factors act to block spread/shift?\r\n&bull;\tIn languages where spread/shift is asymmetrical (e.g. where a H tone spreads or shifts but L does not), what is the source of this asymmetry?\r\n\r\nSome other topics that we&rsquo;ll consider from a broad typological perspective include the representation of tonal contrasts, the potentially variable representation of contour tones, the relationship between tone and segmental properties (especially the laryngeal properties of consonants), and tonal assimilation and dissimilation.\r\nOn the other hand, we&rsquo;ll be looking closely at a wide range of individual languages (e.g. Mazatec, Akan, Hausa, Zulu, Kikuyu, Thai, Cantonese) to see how different tonal processes interact with one another within them, and how our grammar must be structured in order to adequately account for these interactions. We&rsquo;ll pay particularly close attention to real and apparent instances of tonal opacity, which intuitively seem to require elaborate multi-stage derivations. These cases are abundant within tonal phonology, and are one of the main reasons why phonologists working on tone have been reluctant to adopt surface-based theories of phonology like Optimality Theory. There&rsquo;s no consensus opinion right now on how these cases should be handled &ndash; we&rsquo;ll seek to arrive at our own consensus over the course of the semester."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "46022", "description": "\r\n    In the past thirty years of syntactic research, much attention has been paid to the main theoretical questions, and key empirical phenomena, that straddle the boundary between morphology and syntax.

The phenomenon is as old as humanity, but its investigation has exploded in the last decade, giving rise to the formal study of L3 acquisition and multilingualism. This seminar explores individual multilingualism across the lifespan, with a dual attention to learning and teaching. For learning, we will examine types of factors that affect multilingual outcomes. How do the languages of multilinguals interact, and what crosslinguistic effects arise from it? Here two central questions are multidirectional sources of transfer and the multilingual boost in learning new subsequent languages. How does experience of language (e.g., meaningful usage, social networks, domains of use, literacy) shape the multicompetence of multilinguals? Here the overarching themes will be statistical learning and multilingual unlearning and relearning of languages across the life span. How do multilinguals view their environments, their languages, and themselves? In this regard, we will learn about the emic and identity lifeworlds of multilinguals and factors that impact on their well-being, such as language ideologies, beliefs about language learning, multilingual emotions, and perceived positive language interaction. For teaching, we will ask: What are optimal instructional strategies for multilinguals? We will examine proposals such as intercomprehension, translanguaging, and critical language awareness. The seminar is designed so as to support students through an empirical study of multilinguals and their multilingualism in one of the areas covered in the course.

This graduate level seminar will concentrate on theoretical and practical models representing how discourse unfolds across sentences as it grows. We will explore cohesion in text by means of discourse relations (e.g. expressing causality, contrastivity), the use of recurring referring expressions, such as mentions of people, things and events, and how these are coded during language processing. We will also study multiple levels of discourse processing in terms of information structure, discourse relations and theories about anaphora, including classic theories as Centering Theory and Alternative Semantics, and newly developing ones such as Question Under Discussion (QUD) trees.

For most people, and especially in poor countries, jobs are their main source of income. People work their way out of poverty through better and more productive jobs. However, the nature of jobs varies hugely across countries. In high-income economies, jobs will typically have a contractual nature and be associated with a steady pay. In poor countries, jobs are more likely to be associated with self-employment and be more volatile in terms of earnings. The process of development changes the nature of jobs and the conditions of work. At the same time, the types of jobs and employment an economy generates can have spillover effects on the development process itself. Some jobs have a bigger development impact than others.\nIn this course, we will think about jobs, workers and labor markets in the context of economic development. We will examine the following questions: How do jobs change with the development process? Are some jobs better for development? What are the barriers that get in the way of the creation of jobs and the matching of jobs and workers? What is the role of government in addressing those barriers? Do labor markets match workers and jobs in a fair way? What types of inequalities arise in the labor market? What should governments do about them? What kinds of policies can help marginalized groups, youth and women? We will also look at how trade and capital flows, technology and migration transform labor markets, and will discuss how government policies may help address the challenges brought about by these trends.\nThis is a seven-week course. Each week will focus on a core topic and cover the analytical framework; relevant empirical evidence and country examples; and policy solutions and interventions. Classes will be highly interactive and require substantial preparation on the part of students. Topics will include:\n\n1) Jobs, poverty and development\n2) Unemployment, underemployment and informality\n3) Women and work\n4) The challenge of youth employment\n5) Globalization, technology and jobs\n6) Cross-border migration and refugees\n7) Rethinking policies through the jobs lens\n\nPre-requisite:\nThe focus of the course is on policies. However, a good understanding of core economic concepts is necessary. The course will not focus on overly technical tools and methodologies, but will cover some basic analytical frameworks for thinking about labor markets and will use materials that may require a basic understanding of statistical and econometric tools."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "40472", "description": "\r\n    Recent shifts in geopolitical alignments, the rise of a new &ldquo;networked&rdquo; diplomacy, and the increasingly digital nature of the global information space suggest the convergence of data and diplomacy.

However, despite decades of international debate about how to tackle the climate challenge, greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, and the planet continues to warm. Climate change and the associated energy transition are now fundamentally reshaping the international security environment, and these dynamics will have profound consequences for the foreign, economic, and security policies of nearly every country on Earth. This course will examine the ways in which melting ice caps, mass migration, increasing resource conflicts, and other prominent effects of climate change will destabilize societies around the world. Students will assess these risks and make judgments about what can and should be done about them by a range of stakeholders, including national governments, private corporations, and individual citizens. Students will be encouraged to explore the ways in which the problem of global warming intersects with U.S. strategic competition with China, which will likely remain the other major source of uncertainty in the international system for the next several decades. By the end of this course, students will have an informed view of the scale of the problem of climate change as a threat to stability in every region of the world, be able to speak fluently about international energy markets and the prospects for rapid decarbonization of the world&rsquo;s major economies, and understand the divergent perspectives (and interests) of the key players on the global stage as related to climate and energy policy.

Recognized as a distinct marketing discipline since the early 1970s, social marketing has been employed to influence behaviors designed to improve individual health, prevent injuries, protect the environment, and promote other socially beneficial actions. For instance, successful social marketing campaigns have helped reduce and prevent smoking, decrease infant mortality, stop the spread of HIV/AIDs, decrease littering, increase recycling, and drive myriad other societal shifts in the U.S. and across the globe (Andreasen).\n\nWhile the fundamental principles at the core of social marketing are similar to the main tenets of commercial marketing, important distinctions exist in the application of marketing approaches to solving social and environmental problems. Commercial marketing primarily revolves around selling goods and services, with market share and profit being drivers of strategy, while social marketing is used to sell a desired behavior. Social marketing techniques are used to influence target audience behaviors that will benefit society as well as the targeted individuals, but without any financial profit accruing to the marketer. (Kotler and Lee). Social marketing is also different than other marketing disciplines, such as nonprofit marketing (i.e. marketing one NGO); cause marketing (i.e. linking a commercial product&rsquo;s promotion with a cause to boost sales and burnish corporate reputation); and social media marketing (i.e. using social media channels to market a product or cause).\n\nThis course will equip you with an understanding of how to apply social marketing techniques to solve social and environmental challenges, with a particular focus on the priority issues identified in United Nations&rsquo; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are a set of 17 goals agreed upon by 193 countries to improve health, educational outcomes, environmental protection, poverty, and social justice worldwide. In a world increasingly threatened by climate change, conflict, poverty, pandemics and other threats, new and integrated approaches are needed to foster large-scale change. In order to achieve the SDGs, corporate, NGO and government leaders will need to employ social marketing approaches, and this course will identify when such tools are likely to be effective. This course will discuss how to integrate actions across a diverse set of actors, and combine individual behavioral change strategies with more systemic approaches, such as policy advocacy and grassroots coalition building, to create lasting social change at scale.\n\nThis course references concepts covered in other MSB courses such as Strategic Marketing Communications, Consumer Behavior, and Corporate Social Responsibility; however, the unique value add of this course is teaching students how to apply comprehensive planning frameworks and marketing concepts to solve global development challenges through the discipline of social marketing. The main textbooks will be Social Marketing: Changing Behaviors for Good by Nancy R. Lee and Philip Kotler (Fifth Edition), Social Marketing in the 21st Century by Alan R. Andreasen, and Social Marketing and Social Change: Strategies and Tools for Improving Health, Well-Being and the Environment by R. Craig Lefebvre. Readings and class discussion will be complemented by small group work, where students will tackle one of the SDG goals using social marketing methods and tools."}, {"courseReferenceNumber": "34463", "description": "\r\n    MARK 588: Customer Analytics \n\nThis course provides an introduction to the methods employed in customer-centric anlaytics and the resulting applications.
